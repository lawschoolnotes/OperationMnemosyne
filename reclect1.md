Josh Bernstein: Hello everyone, this is going to be a pre recorded class for Cipro for Tuesday July 5 we're going to begin to talk about discovery I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend and.
0:10
Josh Bernstein: let's just jump right into this, I have a PowerPoint prepare one, second, while I share the screen.
0:26
Josh Bernstein: See okay.
0:38
Josh Bernstein: So let's start off by talking about why do we issue discovery, in the first place.
0:40
Josh Bernstein: Later, after we go over all the different types of discovery, we are going to do a little bit of a discovery exercise just a very basic situation, maybe a choleric.
0:46
Josh Bernstein: Or you can represent the plaintiff for the defendant and you're going to come up with some discovery requests.
0:58
Josh Bernstein: Why issue discovery it's, not just because you want to know something you need to know the elements of your causes of action and you need to know the elements of your defenses you kind of you know, when you have a jury trial you use what's called a jury charge.
1:05
Josh Bernstein: And so it would be a very, very good idea to understand the elements of your case or your Defense depending on which side you're on and to.
1:23
Josh Bernstein: And to look at the jury charge and see what specific questions are going to be asked of the jury and what specific things you are going to need to prove.
1:34
Josh Bernstein: It is those kinds of things that you want to ask about in your discovery requests sure you can ask lots of other things, to find out about background and so forth.
1:43
Josh Bernstein: But you really want to ask questions about the the claims and defenses because that is ultimately what you're going to need to prove.
1:53
Josh Bernstein: let's see if we can continue this there we go so.
2:03
Josh Bernstein: there's a big difference between discovery to parties and discovery to non parties, we are going to learn both.
2:07
Josh Bernstein: discovery two parties is the most common thing like you're the plaintiffs and you're issuing discovery to a defendant you're the defendant you're issuing discovery to a point if sometimes there are non parties, for example.
2:16
Josh Bernstein: let's say there is a reason why you want to get some 18 T cell phone records 18 tease not a party so that would be you're trying to.
2:29
Josh Bernstein: obtain those records from the non party let's say you have a motor vehicle wreck between two people and the defendant wants to get records of the injuries that the plaintiffs.
2:40
Josh Bernstein: Has claiming they're sick they sustain you want to get records from a doctor that's a third party, the doctors, not a party so.
2:50
Josh Bernstein: we're going to learn about how to obtain a discovery from non parties right now we are looking at of teams discovery from parties.
2:57
Josh Bernstein: The rules list actually the permissible forms of discovery and the basic formative discovery our request for production and interactive tory's.
3:06
Josh Bernstein: request from production and interactive stories Those are the main forms of what we call written discovery.
3:17
Josh Bernstein: We also have in real 194 disclosures request for disclosures and used to be, they were requested so they're called request requests for disclosures now.
3:23
Josh Bernstein: They are required they're mandatory and we're going to take a close look at the types of information that you are required to share and provide with the opposing side, even if you're not requested you don't.
3:36
Josh Bernstein: Even when it's not requested there's no request needed and there's certain things that must be disclosed to the other side, this is basic forms of information there's no objections or claims of privilege that are permitted and.
3:48
Josh Bernstein: we're going to take a close look at each of these in turn basically we have written discovering we have oral discovery written discovery is the is the exchange of information and documents and oral discovery is like what we see down here or depositions on.
4:04
Josh Bernstein: One second.
4:22
Josh Bernstein: There are also.
4:34
Josh Bernstein: ways in which you can ask for a physical or mental exam or an entry upon land.
4:37
Josh Bernstein: These things are wise it's not highlighted in command.
4:45
Josh Bernstein: These things are of course permitted under the Rules, but they are very rare unless you again.
4:51
Josh Bernstein: Unless you're practicing a certain.
5:00
Josh Bernstein: certain type of.
5:03
Josh Bernstein: certain type of certain area of law, you probably not going to be filing motions for entry upon land once in a while if there's an accident on a site or.
5:04
Josh Bernstein: Something and the other side's not reading you inspect some some physical property or some physical part of what occur, I can foresee that you may have to file a motion for intrude upon land once in a while.
5:13
Josh Bernstein: I think this may have happened in once in my career, there was a part defendant wanted to have his own expert Dr examine the the plaintiffs.
5:28
Josh Bernstein: So they follow the motion for physical exam, but I think i've done the car 190 2.1 C and G maybe once in my career, whereas in every single case we do disclosures we do request for production.
5:39
Josh Bernstein: We do interact tory's admissions are also good tool.
5:54
Josh Bernstein: will go over those as well that they're not issued in every case, but if they're used properly and wisely, they could be very powerful and, of course, depending on the size of the case, we sometimes take depositions as well.
5:58
Josh Bernstein: In private practice, I would say that depositions are taken in almost every case, and then it's not going to resolve, but it will be going to trial, you probably remember.
6:10
Josh Bernstein: In private practice it's very rare to to go to trial and question a witness a trial without having deposed that witness first feature, the basic forms of discovery.
6:21
Josh Bernstein: And we're going to take a look at each one in turn.
6:35
Josh Bernstein: Okay, we we know we talked about this in the first week of of this class that every single thing you do, you must serve on all parties and just to be clear, this is we're not talking about service, a process that's the initial cleaning we're talking about sending.
6:41
Josh Bernstein: These discovery materials to each other party every disclosure every discovery requests every response every objection must be served on all parties.
7:03
Josh Bernstein: If you have a lot of parties, this could get voluminous if you're producing a lot of things, these days, they're produced electronically, but when you are.
7:15
Josh Bernstein: You issuing discovery and responding to discovery, even if it has nothing to do with a certain parties and it's directed towards only one party you still have to share it with all parties everyone on record don't forget about that it's sometimes overlooked.
7:25
Josh Bernstein: Do we file number there's a difference between service and file do we file a discovery with the Court.
7:44
Josh Bernstein: Do we file discovery with the Court, the answer is, for the most part, no, we do not.
8:00
Josh Bernstein: This is a rookie mistake, I see this all the time, in fact, this happened to me this week or someone.
8:07
Josh Bernstein: sent me a discovery request and filed some certificate of discovery with the Court don't do that, that only the only thing that does is tell me that that other attorney does not is not familiar with the rules and doesn't know what they're doing.
8:14
Josh Bernstein: You, the rules are very, very clear on this will 91.4 a says, do not must not must not be five.
8:31
Josh Bernstein: discovery requests discovery responses definitely definitely do not produce to the do not file with the Court, the things you're producing the last thing the Court wants is the documents that you produce to the other side.
8:41
Josh Bernstein: I can't tell you, if you do this if you send things that you're producing to the court if you send a discovery requests or responses to the Court you're going to look.
8:58
Josh Bernstein: Like you don't know what you're doing to the other side you're going to look like you don't know what you're doing to your supervisors and you're going to look like you don't know what you're doing.
9:09
Josh Bernstein: To the Court to the judge those are the things you want to avoid this is a very easy rule to follow we don't do this.
9:17
Josh Bernstein: There are limited circumstances when you do file some discovery materials, for example.
9:26
Josh Bernstein: If you.
9:34
Josh Bernstein: Are.
9:37
Josh Bernstein: filing a response and excuse me filing emotion and asking the Court for some type of affirmative relief like emotion, to compel well then.
9:38
Josh Bernstein: Maybe it's obvious, but if you're filing a motion to compel a specific discovery request or emotion, to ask the Court to rule on a specific objection, then you would absolutely include that discovery request and that response.
9:49
Josh Bernstein: In your motion attached to your motion the following discovery materials must be filed okay number two is motions and responses pertaining to discovery matters.
10:04
Josh Bernstein: Of course we know from the first week of class that we fall rule 11 agreements pertaining to anything it's not a valid rule 11 unless it's on file.
10:16
Josh Bernstein: And also 191 point for be warm, you will see when we talk about discovery to non parties non parties, I talked about this when I introduced this topic, a moment ago.
10:25
Josh Bernstein: it's a very big difference when you're conducting discovery with parties, and when you are conducting discovery with non parties nothing that you send to a party will be filed with the Court everything you sent to a non party will be filed with the Court.
10:38
Josh Bernstein: it's not that confusing, but it is something you absolutely must remember.
10:56
Josh Bernstein: There is what we call a discovery period, this is going to be determined by whether you are in a level one, two or three discovery control plan.
11:06
Josh Bernstein: discovery.
11:18
Josh Bernstein: begins at the beginning of a discovery period discovery ends at the end of the discovery period, in other words, unless.
11:20
Josh Bernstein: You get permission from the Court you're not going to be permitted to conduct discovery after what we call the discovery cut off we're going to see.
11:29
Josh Bernstein: When that is in various types of cases at the beginning of a case remember you no longer need to.
11:38
Josh Bernstein: make a request for disclosure request for disclosures are automatically do we will see in the rules that do about 30 days after the party files that initial cleaning like the answer.
11:48
Josh Bernstein: So 30 days later discovery the the disclosure responses are do, and that is when does it typically begins.
12:00
Josh Bernstein: we're going to look at this in greater detail, but every case has a discovery period and there's a beginning of the discovery period.
12:12
Josh Bernstein: Which is typically after begins after the initial disclosures are due, and then the discovery period ends at what's called the discovery cut off.
12:21
Josh Bernstein: Sometimes, like in a level three case when you have a scheduling order the discovery cut off is going to be a specific date X days before trial in the smaller cases it's going to be it's going to.
12:30
Josh Bernstein: flow from the beginning of the case, in other words the discovery cut off will be let's say 180 days after.
12:43
Josh Bernstein: The initial disclosures or do or something to that effect we're going to take a closer look, but the the discovery period is absolutely something that you need to be familiar with in your case, so that you can properly calculate by when you need to issue and respond to discovery.
12:48
Josh Bernstein: let's talk a little bit about the scope of discovery.
13:09
Josh Bernstein: In general discovery is very, very, very broad in general discovery is very broad, and you can ask questions or seek documentation.
13:13
Josh Bernstein: Regarding any matter that is relevant and not privileged we're going to need to see what relevant means we're going to need to see what not privileged means.
13:27
Josh Bernstein: The fact that something may be in admissible a trial is not a reason why discovery is not permitted on that topic relevance and admissibility are two totally different.
13:39
Josh Bernstein: realms relevance and admissibility are two totally different things when we're conducting discovery, we can seek anything that's relevant we're looking at the definition of relevant in a moment.
14:08
Josh Bernstein: it's under the federal rules, excuse me, the Texas rules of evidence I believe it's for one talks about.
14:20
Josh Bernstein: A piece of information that makes something that is an issue in the case more or less likely.
14:28
Josh Bernstein: let's actually see for this slide here next yes so.
14:36
Josh Bernstein: The definition for relevance is if something has a tendency to make a fact of consequences if you combine a in be a fact of consequence more or less profitable.
14:42
Josh Bernstein: So the depth of the definition of relevance is very, very, very broad almost anything is relevant.
14:55
Josh Bernstein: And if I were taking your deposition or asking you some questions and discovery and I asked you to tell me about the ice cream shop you worked in in the mall when you were a kid that might be relevant.
15:02
Josh Bernstein: might not have anything to do with without what we ultimately proven the courtroom but someone's background is generally relevant.
15:13
Josh Bernstein: people think or that's not that's not relevant, that has nothing to do with anything that people ask about prior lawsuits or prior incidents or prior places of employment, these kinds of things.
15:22
Josh Bernstein: These types of things will all most likely be relevant, but the question of that their admissibility would be something totally different.
15:34
Josh Bernstein: The universe of things it's relevant is very large and as we gather things that are relevant we decide what we're actually going to utilize in court and those things have different rules and.
15:44
Josh Bernstein: In order for them to be admissible for example there's things that are here say you've heard of hearsay, this is not an evidence class, but we all know that certain things might be considered inadmissible hearsay, in other words.
15:57
Josh Bernstein: we obtain a statement from someone and surely a statement from a witness might be relevant has has to do with what occurred, but if we can.
16:10
Josh Bernstein: get around the rules of evidence and the hearsay restrictions that statement, which is relevant may not be admissible and trial, so what 190 2.3 a is saying.
16:21
Josh Bernstein: Is that when we look at the scope of discovery we're not looking to things that we know would be admissible, later on, we are looking to.
16:34
Josh Bernstein: Things that are relevant and not prevalent relevant means that if it has a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less likely more or less probable almost anything is going to be relevant.
16:44
Josh Bernstein: There are limitations on the scope of discovery.
16:59
Josh Bernstein: This what I have highlighted here in the federal rules.
17:03
Josh Bernstein: It discusses of the concept of proportionality, let me see if I have here, I have the federal rule here 26 be also talks about the scope.
17:08
Josh Bernstein: And you can see that anything that is relevant and not privileged and is proportional proportional this concept of proportionality.
17:17
Josh Bernstein: is now included in the Texas rules as well, in other words if you've got a tiny case and you're requesting voluminous records it's probably not proportional and you could object on the basis that is unreasonably.
17:26
Josh Bernstein: burdensome and obtainable from other sources, and our the burden or expense outweighs the benefit this these concepts on the limitations of discovery are called proportionality.
17:43
Josh Bernstein: And if you've got i've got i've got a case right now, where it's a tiny, tiny, tiny case, I think the total amount of controversies like $15,000 and I received.
17:55
Josh Bernstein: discovery like it was almost 100 requests and they also wanted to take about 10 depositions and.
18:07
Josh Bernstein: My response is going to focus on Well, my response did focus on this 190 2.4 hours you know we'll we'll give you a couple of witnesses and we'll give you some some of the relevant documentation, but.
18:15
Josh Bernstein: Your request for 52 items is just it's not proportional to the size of the case and if.
18:27
Josh Bernstein: You know what's going to happen when I respond in that way is they're going to have to make a choice about whether they're going to back down or they're going to insist upon this discovery.
18:34
Josh Bernstein: In my opinion, they should back down if they try to insist that would have been have to do is file a motion to compel with the Court and convince the Court that what they're seeking is proportional to the case and the courts, probably not going to agree and they're going to look stupid.
18:44
Josh Bernstein: So this idea of proportionality is is important, like, I was just sharing the federal rules also discuss proportionality, and this is there's a lot of case law on this and in Texas as well, and the courts are beginning to really.
19:01
Josh Bernstein: frown upon overbroad and unduly burdensome types of discovery requests that are not really proportional to the size of a case.
19:20
Josh Bernstein: One second.
19:33
Josh Bernstein: We talked a moment ago about the difference between admissibility and relevance.
19:37
Josh Bernstein: This used to be a problem it's might sound ridiculous but and I had to i've had this in a few cases.
19:45
Josh Bernstein: A party produces a bunch of records to their own record their own policies procedures employment files training records whatever and when it comes time for me to want to utilize these documents in court.
19:54
Josh Bernstein: They they object and save these documents are not they're not authentic they're not real they're not admissible that they're not whatever and it's just ridiculous.
20:10
Josh Bernstein: In the olden days they would say that these are documents that that you know they produced to me, I should be able to rely on them and Sure enough, after a while pardon me.
20:20
Josh Bernstein: The legislature codified this and we now have rule 190 3.7 which says that a party's production of documents to the other side.
20:36
Josh Bernstein: Self authenticates the documents, in other words authentication is something that is focusing on admissibility for purposes of.
20:46
Josh Bernstein: Their use at trial and their introduction to the Court, I want to introduce this document as an exhibit into evidence, it goes back with the jury it's considered by the judge, that is.
20:54
Josh Bernstein: Those are things which are which are admissible and they need to be authentic there's a couple of rules and the rules of evidence, if you've taken evidence, you know.
21:06
Josh Bernstein: That that, for example, 803 and 902 sometimes business records are accompanied by an affidavit, and that is a way that business records can be authenticated.
21:16
Josh Bernstein: The reason you would authenticate a business records that you can use it a trial and it's admissible rule 190 3.7 says that when a party produces something to the other side it's automatically authenticated for use against that party, not against all parties, but against that party.
21:27
Josh Bernstein: Unless that party says, shortly after producing it, that they have they believe there's a problem with the authenticity and object you using.
21:45
Josh Bernstein: This last clause here unless the party objects within 10 days to your use of that it's kind of rare and mean you know parties are producing their own records their own policies and procedures their own training files their own documents.
21:55
Josh Bernstein: it's rare that a party is going to doubt its own records and give the other side notice that that you can't use certain certain documents.
22:13
Josh Bernstein: You know if something is not authentic there are ways to prove it we call prove it up to prove it up, but like with a business record for example under 803 or nine or two.
22:25
Josh Bernstein: But this just makes it a lot easier again remember what these rules are designed to to make these cases smooth and cost efficient.
22:36
Josh Bernstein: A party no longer has to go crazy to prove up all the documents that were produced by the other side, now they are automatically authenticated under Rule 190 3.7 so that that.
22:45
Josh Bernstein: Against that party, so that I can use them a trial against a party if I want to use them a trial against another party and I have to properly authenticate them under the rules of evidence.
22:59
Josh Bernstein: What documents do you have to produce when documents are requested of you, there is a phrase that is using the rules called possession custody or control.
23:15
Josh Bernstein: possession custody or control means that you have the right to the document let's just say that someone requests documents from me and let's just say I am.
23:26
Josh Bernstein: You know, I have the documents, but they are in my office right So do I have the right to possess these documents do I have possession of these documents, what about bank statements, for example, in some cases bank statements are relevant.
23:40
Josh Bernstein: Do I have the the right to.
23:58
Josh Bernstein: To get bank statements I mean you mean For those of you who are quite young, you may not actually be familiar with paper bank statements but.
24:01
Josh Bernstein: You can you can go to the bank and your you can get on your online banking and print out a bank statement.
24:12
Josh Bernstein: Just because that might be, you know online or might be at the bank doesn't mean that it's not in your possession custody or control things that you have a right to possess.
24:18
Josh Bernstein: That is, those are going to be considered things that you have in your possession custody or control now if you have to do certain things and jump through certain hoops to get certain things, then that might be.
24:30
Josh Bernstein: There might be a reason why they're not in your possession custody or control or if a party has an equal right to get these things, for example, there's public records or anything that's available publicly.
24:44
Josh Bernstein: Then one party might not have a superior right to those documents, but in general.
24:58
Josh Bernstein: You have to produce anything that's really within your grasp and that's going to be considered within your possession custody or control.
25:04
Josh Bernstein: In other words, when documents are requested of you you're going to have to do a little bit of gathering, if you have access to certain files certain places, you can talk to certain people.
25:11
Josh Bernstein: And, and if it's easy to get them with just simple request then they're going to be considered in your possession custody or control and you're going to have to obtain them and produce them.
25:24
Josh Bernstein: So now we're going to start looking at specific types of discovery.
25:38
Josh Bernstein: That are covered within the that are covered within the rules and also covered within what are called the disclosures we're going to talk about this, this is an example of something that you must.
25:45
Josh Bernstein: disclose whether you are asked, or not we're going to look at the mechanics of the disclosures in a minute right now we're looking at the.
25:58
Josh Bernstein: types of things that are considered to be within discovery and they're so core to discovery that they are part of required disclosures and we can see under Rule 190 2.5 that these are expressly excluded excluded from work product.
26:07
Josh Bernstein: Okay, in other words, you cannot object to this, you cannot make a claim of privilege, I have seen it i've seen it in fact last week.
26:25
Josh Bernstein: Last week I received the discovery response, where we're going to turn the claim that he didn't want to disclose some people.
26:35
Josh Bernstein: You know, with knowledge and.
26:43
Josh Bernstein: All that says it's in a major red flag it's a major red flag, it says this attorney is solely trying to cause trouble.
26:47
Josh Bernstein: And I follow the motion with the Court and the Court granted the motion in two seconds and all.
26:55
Josh Bernstein: shows is that the Attorney who is saying that persons with knowledge our privilege or not discoverable It just shows either that they don't know what they're doing.
27:02
Josh Bernstein: or they'd hadn't read the Rules or, more likely they're just trying to cause trouble and no court is going to like any more than that objects to providing.
27:11
Josh Bernstein: A list of persons with knowledge, a lot of people call this a P wk lists person P with wk knowledge pw K list trying to highlight this year.
27:22
Josh Bernstein: pw K that's why I have it down here pw K list pw K lists, you cannot object to be wk list or not privilege.
27:40
Josh Bernstein: And you have to do a little bit of research, and you have to share without being asked a list of the people that you believe have knowledge.
27:48
Josh Bernstein: This second part here about a brief statement we're talking very, very, very brief we're talking like this person was a witness this person was the injured employee this person is a supervisor that was on duty you don't have to write a paragraph.
27:59
Josh Bernstein: i've I can't remember ever really anyone complaining or me complaining or anyone complaining about one of my responses that my brief statement identifying the person's connection with the case was insufficient that's not usually the cause of of the source of discovery disputes.
28:15
Josh Bernstein: In rule 190 2.3.
28:41
Josh Bernstein: there's a comment about experts, we are going to talk about experts.
28:44
Josh Bernstein: Later, when we talk about expert discovery, but an expert what the second paragraph, and Rule 190 2.3 C is saying is that typically an expert is not a person with knowledge.
28:49
Josh Bernstein: doesn't go on your P wk list typically an expert is someone that you are going to retain to render an opinion, the expert is going to be retained the expert is going to review material that you provide the expert and then the expert is going to render an opinion a trial.
29:01
Josh Bernstein: That is not someone that has knowledge of relevant facts.
29:21
Josh Bernstein: One once in a while once in a while an expert might be either someone who was involved in the case, who has some expertise like someone who was working at the time of the incident.
29:26
Josh Bernstein: And was present and observe things but also happens to have some specialized knowledge.
29:40
Josh Bernstein: And that person would be a person with knowledge, but may also be designated as an expert and then another possible nuance would be an expert that actually goes that is hired and retain that doesn't really work for one of the parties until their retained but.
29:45
Josh Bernstein: goes to the site and actually has does a site inspection and has first hand knowledge of what they saw themselves there's a difference between.
30:02
Josh Bernstein: You know, personal knowledge and reviewing some some documents personal knowledge is things that you.
30:12
Josh Bernstein: saw or heard yourself, I had a case last year, where an expert went to a site and conducted reenactment.
30:19
Josh Bernstein: The expert went to the site, the expert to video and photograph the expert talk to witnesses, this is this is rare, and this is.
30:26
Josh Bernstein: Very different than an expert who was retained a year later, after an incident and is provided with the file to review.
30:33
Josh Bernstein: The expert that has hired a year later, and provided with the file to review is not a person with knowledge.
30:41
Josh Bernstein: The expert that's hired immediately and goes to the site and talks to witnesses himself.
30:47
Josh Bernstein: or herself and photos and videos and inspects the site him or herself that might be an expert with knowledge personal knowledge and that would that expert would have to go on the pw K was for that reason.
30:52
Josh Bernstein: pw K list again it's not something you can object to and it's not something that you claim a privilege when people are.
31:07
Josh Bernstein: When it when it's when it's requested one second.
31:16
Josh Bernstein: So about that let's continue.
31:23
Josh Bernstein: Okay, persons with knowledge in wk list you have to provide in every case you can't object it's not privileged sometimes attorneys try to say that.
31:31
Josh Bernstein: Who i'm going to call a trial who's well who knows things about its attorney client privilege it's worth product it's not it's expressly excluded from your product don't say that.
31:41
Josh Bernstein: trial witnesses.
31:54
Josh Bernstein: De you may not know your trial witnesses at the beginning of litigation.
31:58
Josh Bernstein: But it is not privileged.
32:06
Josh Bernstein: It is expressly excluded from work product.
32:10
Josh Bernstein: You must disclose your trial witnesses.
32:14
Josh Bernstein: In your disclosures now what I typically do.
32:19
Josh Bernstein: With regard to D trial witnesses and we had si P wk list is I typically say that I don't know this is because of the disclosures from member of the first things that occur in litigation.
32:24
Josh Bernstein: And you're typically providing the required disclosures within a month of the defendant answering the case, and you may not know who you're going to call trial, you should know who.
32:41
Josh Bernstein: It should be on your pw K list from your review of the file as an attorney so your your pw K list should be as complete as possible.
32:55
Josh Bernstein: Definitely your pw K list is going to be way longer than your trial witness list.
33:06
Josh Bernstein: As litigation continues, and as you start to talk to some of these people review things learn things, maybe take some depositions you're going to start to pare down your trial witness list, but, at the beginning of.
33:12
Josh Bernstein: The litigation what I typically do is I say from my trial witness list, I refer to my pw K list, in other words, I say it is too early right now to.
33:26
Josh Bernstein: know who i'm going to call a trial, but I may call anyone on my pw K list that think about that what that means is your pw K, which should be very exhaustive.
33:37
Josh Bernstein: Because you can't call someone for trial as a witness, who is not on your pw K list, do you want to over over designate over list people on your pw K list anything anybody that appears in any document that may have knowledge that was around that saw something that was a Co worker whatever.
33:48
Josh Bernstein: Because if you fail to list them on your person with knowledge list then you're not going to be able to just add them to a trial witness list later, so the way I typically do it is and making my pw K list very extensive and I refer to it in my trial witness response and as.
34:13
Josh Bernstein: You know, as as the case proceeds, if I can narrow down who my witnesses might be either on the on the plaintiff side or on the Defense side, then you can always supplement your your trial witness list as you get closer to trial.
34:31
Josh Bernstein: Experts.
34:47
Josh Bernstein: There two kinds of experts.
34:50
Josh Bernstein: there's testifying experts and consulting experts.
34:53
Josh Bernstein: You may see you may be exploring.
35:00
Josh Bernstein: And running things by an expert early in the litigation and you may get a response from an expert, you may provide the experts in material and you may get a response from an expert that you don't like.
35:04
Josh Bernstein: An expert may have questions about the theory of your case or better claims or defenses and may not be the right expert they may not be qualified they may be qualified, but may not want to support what you're saying.
35:17
Josh Bernstein: And if you decide not to use that expert if you provide that expert material, but you don't do anything more with that expert and you just forget about that expert that expert can be considered what's called a consulting only expert and that expert then does not need to be.
35:29
Josh Bernstein: disclosed to to any other side if you make the mistake of providing some of that consulting experts material or conclusions or opinions to another expert.
35:49
Josh Bernstein: An extra second expert that you like, and that you intend to utilize a trial and that consulting only expert becomes discoverable So if you have an expert that you don't like do not provide anything.
36:02
Josh Bernstein: From that expert to another expert the identity mental impressions in the opinions of a consulting expert who's mental impressions and opinions have not.
36:19
Josh Bernstein: been reviewed not been reviewed are not discoverable if you send the opinions and conclusions of a consulting expert to a testifying expert, then they are discoverable.
36:29
Josh Bernstein: As we're going to see throughout this discussion about discovery in the scope of discovery, there are going to be certain things which are privileged.
36:45
Josh Bernstein: For example, a consulting only expert is privileged it's not it's not something that you need to disclose there's other things that are privileged as well.
36:53
Josh Bernstein: But if you provide privileged material to an expert guess what it becomes not privileged it becomes discoverable you've waived your privilege, if you have material that is 100% privilege there's no question.
37:01
Josh Bernstein: And you send that to an expert to review all of a sudden you've waived your privilege so you've got to be careful.
37:14
Josh Bernstein: This happens to me and many, many, many cases where I see younger attorneys providing an entire file.
37:21
Josh Bernstein: So, at the beginning of the litigation, we have an entire file and then we have some stuff that we move that's privileged and then we have what's called the redacted file that's produced to the Defense or to the other side to the plaintiffs.
37:28
Josh Bernstein: And it's the redacted file that must be given to experts.
37:42
Josh Bernstein: The Non privileged portions of the file if you give a complete file and i've seen this done too often if you give a complete file to an expert.
37:48
Josh Bernstein: Including stuff that you claimed was privileged when you were producing it to the other side guess what that stuff becomes not privileged it's the same thing with an expert.
37:57
Josh Bernstein: Will 190 2.3 is really talking about testifying expert, of course, it defines what testifying expert into consulting expert is.
38:09
Josh Bernstein: But for testifying expert, you have to share certain information you have to share their identity, you have to share their mental impressions and opinions and, in certain instances, you have to share a report you can't claim an objection or a privilege to.
38:18
Josh Bernstein: To expert discovery.
38:35
Josh Bernstein: You may not have an expert at the beginning of the litigation, in which case you say we have not designated any experts at this time, but you have a duty to supplement we're going to see the rules about supplementation and.
38:38
Josh Bernstein: As the litigation proceeds if you then have an expert you're going to have to supplement your discovery or designate, your expert later, but there's certain things that must be provided regarding a testifying expert remember a testifying expert, not a consulting expert.
38:52
Josh Bernstein: And remember it's a consulting expert who is it consulting only expert does not have to be disclosed, if you have a consulting expert that you have run that person's opinions by a testifying.
39:08
Josh Bernstein: The consulting expert does have to be disclosed don't make that mistake.
39:21
Josh Bernstein: Insurance this is, you know typically we a lot of cases like motor vehicle MED now.
39:28
Josh Bernstein: You know other kinds of professional liability there's always insurance and.
39:35
Josh Bernstein: You have to if you're the defendant you have to produce the insurance agreement.
39:41
Josh Bernstein: Now note the last sentence here just because you produce the insurance agree minute doesn't mean it's admissible at trial in fact it's almost 100% certain that insurance is not going to be admissible a trial.
39:44
Josh Bernstein: In other words, this is a great example of something that the legislature has deemed to be relevant and discoverable and require to be produced.
39:56
Josh Bernstein: But it is not admissible You might remember from our discussion about multiple parties, I think it was in New 38 a talking about bringing in.
40:05
Josh Bernstein: A defendant bringing in another party, who is or may be liable to to the plaintiff for the plaintiffs claims and I think there was a specific part of Rule 38 it said that.
40:14
Josh Bernstein: That we don't bring in insurance carriers for that, under that rule, so this is consistent with that we don't bring in insurance carriers at as parties and insurance agreements are not admissible at trial.
40:27
Josh Bernstein: However, if an insurance agreement exists, which is, which is.
40:42
Josh Bernstein: available to satisfy all a part of a judgment, then you must share that as as a defendant if your client has insurance, you must share it is not there is no objection that can be made to an insurance policy, it is a part of the required disclosures.
40:49
Josh Bernstein: Set up settlement agreements same exact thing is insurance agreements, there may be a case where you have multiple parties and some parties settle out.
41:08
Josh Bernstein: And settlements are relevant to the case at bar and again it is there's no objection if you settle the case, and you are involved in a case and you reach a settlement, you must produce that settlement.
41:17
Josh Bernstein: Again it's 100% not admissible a trial, just like an insurance agreements not admissible a settlement agreement side admissible, but you must produce it, you must disclose it if a settlement agreement exists, you have to disclose it there's no objection that can be had.
41:34
Josh Bernstein: Again, these are all things which is the the discussion we're having about the scope of discovery meaning, these are permissible things within the scope of discovery notice that every single thing that's got that's in more 190 2.3.
41:51
Josh Bernstein: In the general discussion of scope of discovery is also contained in real 194 and as part of required disclosures if you notice on each of these slides settlement agreements.
42:05
Josh Bernstein: Insurance agreements experts trial witnesses pw K list they're all part of required disclosures and they're all, of course, part of.
42:17
Josh Bernstein: permissible discovery and you can't object to them, and you can't claim work product.
42:29
Josh Bernstein: Statements statements are a little bit trickier.
42:35
Josh Bernstein: A statement.
42:42
Josh Bernstein: Many times when people are let's say interviewing.
42:45
Josh Bernstein: A witness they're taking down notes, if the witness this not sign or adopt one second my battery is running low one second.
42:50
Josh Bernstein: If a witness does not sign or adopt.
43:07
Josh Bernstein: The notes in some way than it is not a witness statement.
43:12
Josh Bernstein: Will.
43:19
Josh Bernstein: is very specific when it talks about a statement there's a definition of statement.
43:21
Josh Bernstein: And a definition of a statement is something that has to be signed or adopted by the witness okay note note, take note of this sentence here that notes.
43:27
Josh Bernstein: taken during an interview or not a witness statement unless the person signs are adopted.
43:40
Josh Bernstein: So there, it is very common when lawyers and lawyers, sometimes go interview witnesses and even investigators go interview witnesses.
43:47
Josh Bernstein: And sometimes witnesses sign their statements and it's called a signed statement or a statement and sometimes witnesses refuse to sign the statement.
43:56
Josh Bernstein: And in that case, it is considered notes, it is not considered a statement now if you obtain a if you interview someone and they don't sign it.
44:06
Josh Bernstein: And it is considered notes and not a statement, you can still produce it, you don't have to claim that it's attorney client privilege or work product privilege.
44:18
Josh Bernstein: You just you don't have to produce it, but you don't have to withhold it the question when younger attorneys come to me, and they say this statements not signed what should I do with it.
44:30
Josh Bernstein: My first response is typically well it's not a statement so don't call it a statement it's no it's because the more important question is, would you like to be able to use this.
44:43
Josh Bernstein: At trial, would you like to be able to use this later in the litigation, do you think that this person said, good things that you feel like you want the other party to know.
44:55
Josh Bernstein: Okay, so, in other words, the statement is helpful to us of the notes are helpful to us why not share them, because if you don't share them, then you definitely cannot use them later if you do share them, then it becomes part of the record and you can try to get them.
45:05
Josh Bernstein: You know to be admissible or utilize them later when you're taking a deposition or or whatever so.
45:25
Josh Bernstein: The ultimate question is is is do you want to use these notes, do you like what is stated in these notes.
45:32
Josh Bernstein: If so, then, then you should produce them but note that a witness statement is a signed witness statement and assigned witness statement is not work product you can't object to it, you have to produce it.
45:41
Josh Bernstein: it's also part of the required disclosures if it's not signed, then it is just considered notes.
45:57
Josh Bernstein: And you don't have to produce it as part of the required disclosures but you also don't have to withhold it, you can ask yourself do I, like this do I want to use this and, if you like, it and want to utilize it then you can produce it.
46:05
Josh Bernstein: Potential parties again, this is something else that is part of the discovery process, as well as part of the required disclosures and remember when we talked about adding parties and there's always a.
46:21
Josh Bernstein: You know, a potential limitations issue, so this is why the rules require early on in the case for a.
46:38
Josh Bernstein: Each party to identify all other parties that they think may be considered potential parties sometimes there may not be any but sometimes there may be some.
46:46
Josh Bernstein: This rule is designed to prevent people on the eve of trial or late late late in the game way after the Statute has run from saying Oh well, we have someone else is there may be liable.
46:56
Josh Bernstein: You know, in this case, they should be a party you can't do that at the end, you have to do that at the beginning and that's what that's what this will talks about again it's part of required disclosures and again it's not expressly not work product it's excluded from work product.
47:09
Josh Bernstein: contentions this is, this is an area where attorneys like to think.
47:28
Josh Bernstein: That this is work product and claim that their contentions our work product, but again, this if you if you are asked what's called a contention interactive story, do you contain.
47:34
Josh Bernstein: or a contention request for production like if you contend X then produce documents which support that contention, if you are asked these questions, these are perfectly valid questions.
47:45
Josh Bernstein: If you object to these questions on the basis that it's privileged or work product what is someone going to think okay.
47:56
Josh Bernstein: The rules expressly expressly say that contention in Toronto Tories are permitted and expressly says it's not work product.
48:05
Josh Bernstein: it's not work product.
48:18
Josh Bernstein: So if you as an attorney object to a contention in Toronto tori saying when i'm not going to answer that that's my attorney mental impression that's my work product.
48:20
Josh Bernstein: What is someone going to think about that the other side is going to say this person does not know the rules and if emotion, to compel is filed.
48:30
Josh Bernstein: To force to get the quarter to or to overrule your objection you're going to look really bad to the Court, like you, don't you haven't read the Rules either.
48:41
Josh Bernstein: When I issue discovery, I always issue multiple contention into Raja Tories and request your production, I always ask you know, do you contend acts.
48:51
Josh Bernstein: As if you contend X provide the factual basis facts are never protected facts are always discoverable.
49:03
Josh Bernstein: Okay, if you contend X then provide the factual basis if you contend X identify someone who can testify about it last week, I issued I got back some discovery responses and because the defendants personal knowledge, this was very lengthy and I didn't know who was who.
49:10
Josh Bernstein: tension and derogatory if you can tend to X tell me who can talk about that, and they identified a person.
49:31
Josh Bernstein: Who is knowledgeable on that topic and I went up taking that person's deposition and that's how I got to that.
49:37
Josh Bernstein: So these are these are typical questions are good questions are valid questions if you can tend to X provide the factual basis if you contend dex.
49:44
Josh Bernstein: identify someone who could talk about it, and if you can tend to X, then I issue a request your production produce documents which support your contention.
49:53
Josh Bernstein: These are very permissive little discovery requests that are expressly excluded from work product, and they are, they are permitted under the Rules.
50:01
Josh Bernstein: So, again I want to review this again, these are things you're going to need to know what they are understand that they're there they're.
50:13
Josh Bernstein: Part of the permissible scope of discovery and they're they're almost all part of required disclosures we have potential parties we have statements we have.
50:22
Josh Bernstein: Settlement agreements we have insurance agreements we have testifying experts trial witnesses and pw K list these are things which are part of required disclosures, and these are things which which must be produced early on, without even being asked.
50:34
Josh Bernstein: discovery control plans.
50:54
Josh Bernstein: We talked about this previously and now we're going to look at the mechanics of discovery control plans.
50:58
Josh Bernstein: discovery control plans.
51:16
Josh Bernstein: So there's three levels of discovery and and we talked about this before we saw this in the plates pleadings according to.
51:22
Josh Bernstein: Every case must be governed by a plane in every case must have pardon me alleged in the first number paragraph.
51:32
Josh Bernstein: Whether it's going to be under Level one, two or three.
51:40
Josh Bernstein: In a nutshell, Level one is applies to the smallest cases Level three applies to the largest cases and Level two applies to all other cases this is, in a nutshell.
51:45
Josh Bernstein: With each level, you need to understand a little bit about the applicability, in other words which types of cases does that level apply to and then, of course, you need to understand the limitations that or the lack of limitations in each.
51:58
Josh Bernstein: In each level.
52:12
Josh Bernstein: The legislature just raised the cap on a level one to 250 last year and used to be, I think 50 or 100 now it's 250 so.
52:16
Josh Bernstein: A level one case applies to cases that are under 215 those are sometimes referred to as expedited cases and under 169 We may, if we have time look at what qualifies for rule 169 expedited.
52:26
Josh Bernstein: And also divorces, with no kids okay.
52:41
Josh Bernstein: And this is a level one case the discovery period is about six months discovery is very limited, these Level one cases are designed to be small quick, efficient inexpensive types of cases.
52:46
Josh Bernstein: Level two case let's jump to level three level three cases of the most complex cases and Level three cases, the parties proposed what's called a scheduling order you can put in the scheduling order any kind of limit or lack of limit you want.
53:01
Josh Bernstein: And and that's that's very common.
53:16
Josh Bernstein: In a level two case again Level two cases or any case where there's not a request for a scheduling order under Level three or any case that's not governed.
53:21
Josh Bernstein: By expedited or under 250 that's governed by Level one level two cases.
53:30
Josh Bernstein: You get a little bit longer for discovery period about nine months and discovery is not as limited as it is a level one case, when I say discovery is limited we're going to see in a minute.
53:37
Josh Bernstein: The amount of certain types of written discovery, the amount of certain types of oral discovery it's all limited it's all spelled out in the Rules let's take a closer look.
53:48
Josh Bernstein: So a level one case we'll just move this way.
53:59
Josh Bernstein: A level one case.
54:06
Josh Bernstein: Is cases involving to 50 or less or divorces, but no kids and again, first we look at the applicability we just saw that second is the discovery period of discovery period is that the period within which you are permitted to conduct discovery.
54:10
Josh Bernstein: The discovery period begins in all cases Level one level two Level three the discovery period begins in all cases when.
54:30
Josh Bernstein: The responses to the initial disclosures are do the responses to the initial disclosures are typically do about 30 days after the defendant files and answer.
54:40
Josh Bernstein: The rules used to provide that that the discovery period begins when the defendant filed the answer, but they all the discovery room the discovery rules also used to say that.
54:53
Josh Bernstein: They require, but let me start this over the discovery rules, used to say that you had to issue requests for disclosure.
55:07
Josh Bernstein: And that discovery period can begin, like you, are permitted to issue these disclosures when the defendant files, the answer that is tweak and change a little bit now.
55:17
Josh Bernstein: As of last year in the last year or so now you don't have to issue requests for disclosures now they're called required disclosures and their do 30 days after the defendant answers so.
55:26
Josh Bernstein: 30 days after the defendant answers that's when disclosures are due and that's when the discovery period begins.
55:40
Josh Bernstein: Under a level one plan the discovery period begins, excuse me continues for six months in the in the.
55:48
Josh Bernstein: In the Level one plan you get 20 hours to take depositions typically depositions if you know what you're doing and you're efficient they last few hours.
55:56
Josh Bernstein: Sometimes they can last all day a typical eight hour day, if you think about it.
56:08
Josh Bernstein: If you take an eight hour day to to depose somebody, then you are only going to be able to take two and a half depositions under Level one so Level one cases, not the kind of case where you're taking all day depose have multiple people.
56:13
Josh Bernstein: If you have one or two witnesses and you think you can ask them a couple of questions in a couple hours each in a level, one might be appropriate in derogatory he's no more than 15.
56:30
Josh Bernstein: No more than 15 interrogative worries, no more than 15 requests, no more than 15 admissions.
56:41
Josh Bernstein: Okay later when we go over the specifics of interactive stories requests when I say requests that's requested production interactive tours requests and admissions when I say admissions I mean request for admissions, but you can only issue.
56:47
Josh Bernstein: requests and emotions.
57:04
Josh Bernstein: Under Level one so again if this if your cases that kind of case where you're going to need more discovery you're not going to want to be in in Level one.
57:08
Josh Bernstein: Two things here.
57:19
Josh Bernstein: We saw earlier, I believe it's in will 190 3.7 the documents that are produced by a party are automatically authenticated for use against that party.
57:25
Josh Bernstein: There may be other instances in which you might be asking another party to authenticate certain documents, perhaps documents that were produced by a third party by another co you know co defendant or co plane if.
57:36
Josh Bernstein: And as you can see, under the Rules that interactive stories where you're merely asking someone to authenticate a document it's not going to be counted.
57:50
Josh Bernstein: towards your 15 also there's a note here that says that when you are counting your 15 discreet sub parts are counted as individual interrogative stories when it's a discrete sub part.
57:59
Josh Bernstein: This is an area of contention there's actually a definition in the comment we're going to see it in a second.
58:15
Josh Bernstein: But you know.
58:21
Josh Bernstein: it's it's it's very Gray, but.
58:25
Josh Bernstein: You know it's ripe for abuse, let me give you an example let's say I asked to write a story, please state your name your home address your business address.
58:29
Josh Bernstein: and your date of birth right you're holding your name your your your home address your business address and your date of birth that's is that for discrete some parts or is that really one interactive tori.
58:41
Josh Bernstein: I think most people would agree that's one interactive story, of course, I have seen people object to that as for interactive stories or counted as for interactive stories before discrete sub parts, if you.
58:57
Josh Bernstein: Are they responding party to that question and you count that as for and then later, you object, as the questions went over the 15 limit or under the other Level two or you can ask 30.
59:10
Josh Bernstein: And you said you start injecting that this exceeds the permissible amount of interactive stories and the basis for your accounting is you counted that one as for.
59:26
Josh Bernstein: The courts not going to be happy with you, the Court is not going to be happy with you, so, while this area is grey let's see if we have the definition here have.
59:35
Josh Bernstein: No, I have it in one of the slides here will 190 or comment three.
59:48
Josh Bernstein: And the courts acknowledge it's not susceptible over precise definition, but if the information that's not really logically or factually related to the to the primary into Rocker tori.
59:53
Josh Bernstein: Then it's going to be counted as a separate into Roger tori you know you know let's say you ask someone what their.
1:00:07
Josh Bernstein: You know home address is an ask them to list their employment history for the last 10 years that is unrelated if you ask someone their name, address and phone number thats related and again always ask yourself remember in these.
1:00:16
Josh Bernstein: In these types of situations where it's Gray, the true audience here with a discovery dispute is going to be the judge.
1:00:36
Josh Bernstein: The true audience is going to be the judge and you need to ask yourself how is a judge going to view what i'm doing.
1:00:46
Josh Bernstein: I can tell you right now judges absolutely hate discovery disputes, and if you have a discovery dispute that you're really trying to bring before the Court, a better damn well be very, very, very valid one second.
1:00:53
Josh Bernstein: Okay let's see where we were.
1:01:09
Josh Bernstein: Okay we're talking about discrete sub parts again.
1:01:20
Josh Bernstein: who's the judge who's the who's the true audience, the true audiences the judge, particularly with discovery disputes, you know.
1:01:24
Josh Bernstein: I sometimes take a hard line when i'm responding to discovery and I wait and see what the requesting party is going to do.
1:01:33
Josh Bernstein: And if the requesting party demands more from me and makes a good argument, then I will likely.
1:01:45
Josh Bernstein: give more information and more documents before I insist on my position and go to court, of course, if they are being unreasonable with their requests.
1:01:53
Josh Bernstein: And I feel strongly about an objection or response that I have lodged or privilege that i've asserted then.
1:02:03
Josh Bernstein: Then i'm going to stick by it, but remember the true judges the audience mature audiences the judge whenever you go before the judge you got to make sure that you're making a good argument, the discrete sub parts is a Gray area I have seen.
1:02:11
Josh Bernstein: You know it's quite common for for my opposing.
1:02:26
Josh Bernstein: attorneys to object on the basis that i've asked too many interrogative stories and they count too many things as a sweet sub parts, you know i've got a practice tip down here and I mentioned to you before that.
1:02:32
Josh Bernstein: I asked a lot of contention interactive stories typically about the affirmative defenses and the defenses that are raised.
1:02:49
Josh Bernstein: If if a defendant has 20 or 30 or even 10 or 15 affirmative defenses which are mostly baseless, then I should be permitted to ask.
1:02:55
Josh Bernstein: derogatory and contentions about each of those defenses and if it's going to take me over my 15 or my 30 or my whatever limit that's not my fault that's your fault for for for making.
1:03:06
Josh Bernstein: For pleading too many defenses, what do you think of course going to do if you've got 30 defenses and.
1:03:17
Josh Bernstein: And I asked questions about each of those defenses do you think of course going to say no you're limited to 15 and derogatory is the courts going to say to the the other.
1:03:25
Josh Bernstein: Side you're the one making these defenses if you're going to stick with these defenses.
1:03:33
Josh Bernstein: Then the other side is going to be permitted to conduct discovery about your defenses if you're not going to stick with these defenses and amend your answer.
1:03:38
Josh Bernstein: and withdraw some of these defenses This is very routine this happens often so again, who is your audience.
1:03:44
Josh Bernstein: Okay, if you're going to do things and you're going to plead things, then you should expect someone to conduct discovery on them you can't plead a bunch of things and then object to someone trying to conduct discovery based on your pleadings don't do that.
1:03:52
Josh Bernstein: Of course, the Court is going to grant me leave to ask a few additional questions which are specifically tailored to the claims and defenses of the case, of course, the courts going to do that, so if you're.
1:04:08
Josh Bernstein: If you're on, on the other side of that don't insist on making someone go before the court to request that because you're just going to look really bad.
1:04:20
Josh Bernstein: let's go back up to where we were.
1:04:29
Josh Bernstein: We were talking about.
1:04:34
Josh Bernstein: Okay we're talking about Level one and the limitations and here we have a level two.
1:04:36
Josh Bernstein: Level two again Level two cases or cases which are not Level one cases and not Level three cases, the discovery period as a little bit longer remember the discovery period in a level one is six months.
1:04:42
Josh Bernstein: And six months from when six months from when the discovery period begins when does this discovery period begin the discovery period begins when the first.
1:04:56
Josh Bernstein: When the responses to the initial disclosures are do discovery plant period under Level two is a little bit longer When does it begin same analysis it begins when the responses to the initial disclosures are do, which is typically 30 days after the defendant files a dancer.
1:05:06
Josh Bernstein: and
1:05:27
Josh Bernstein: let's just take out for a second family code so we're not going to talk about this first.
1:05:29
Josh Bernstein: area because it's a very specific yeah but in and I haven't even highlighted in red what i've highlighted in red is that the discovery period is going to close either and it's the earlier of the earlier of 30 days before trial or nine months after the the disclosures are.
1:05:36
Josh Bernstein: Okay, so let's just take a look at this for a second today is let's say today is.
1:05:58
Josh Bernstein: What is today June 30 right June 30 so that let's say just hypothetically that a defendant files is answer today okay so.
1:06:05
Josh Bernstein: When our disclosures when is the discovery period and it became the discovery periods going to begin when the first disclosures are do one of the first disclosures do that if 30 days from today.
1:06:17
Josh Bernstein: So i'm just going to write this down, so we can not get confused, so the defendant answers on 38 the first disclosure responses will be due on July 30 roughly i'm just going with the calendar 30 days later right so July 30 so.
1:06:28
Josh Bernstein: Ah.
1:06:48
Josh Bernstein: Then, when does the discovery period and let's say the Court sets this case for trial on July 30 of.
1:06:51
Josh Bernstein: Okay that's that more than nine months out yes it's about 12 months out Okay, so when is the discovery period going to end his discovery period going to end 30 days before trial.
1:07:02
Josh Bernstein: 30 days for trial would be June 30 2023 is that and when is nine months after the disclosure should do so again answer file today disclosures are due on July 30 so nine months after July 30 is August 13 August September, October November, December January, February, March, April 30 okay.
1:07:16
Josh Bernstein: let's just double check that today's the disclosures are do July 30 August September, October November.
1:07:44
Josh Bernstein: December January, February, March, April so assuming I counted correctly, nine months after.
1:07:54
Josh Bernstein: The initial disclosures are do.
1:08:03
Josh Bernstein: Think I calculated that world home on a second, no, no, I calculated that right answers file today, the initial disclosures are due on July 30 Nine months later, is April 30th.
1:08:09
Josh Bernstein: Under this scenario, under this scenario y'all need to processes in your mind and write it down on paper, if you get confused.
1:08:23
Josh Bernstein: This is very, very, very, very critical, you need to know this as attorneys and will probably need to know this for exams and for being an attorney but just knowing the discovery period is something that is very, very important in this scenario.
1:08:32
Josh Bernstein: Under this level two scenario 30 days before trial in my hypothetical was June 39 months after the first initial disclosures are do was April 30 so when does the discovery period end the discovery period ends on April 30 earlier of those two days.
1:08:50
Josh Bernstein: Again i'm stressing, you need to know about discovery periods, as you can see the limitations for discovery or a little bit broader.
1:09:13
Josh Bernstein: In level of 20 hours for demos and Level two you got 50 hours for demos and Level one you are limited, with your interactive stories your requests and your admissions to.
1:09:24
Josh Bernstein: And Level two you're only limited in your interactive Tories and it's to 25 you are not limited on your requests or your admissions.
1:09:37
Josh Bernstein: No limitations on requests or admissions and your internal controls, you get 25 again same rules if you're if you're asking to authenticate it doesn't count each discrete sub part is is a.
1:09:47
Josh Bernstein: Is a is a is a separate into rhonda tori.
1:10:00
Josh Bernstein: You need to know the applicability and limitations of a level one and Level two case.
1:10:04
Josh Bernstein: Ah, oh, this is what i've been repeating that the initial disclosures are do 30 days after the first answer.
1:10:11
Josh Bernstein: And that's typically when a discovery period begins a 190 4.28 that's what I put in here.
1:10:19
Josh Bernstein: I put in here see 190 4.2 a and I also saw it here see when I did four point to raise the discovery period begins when the first initial disclosures are doing, one of the first initial disclosures do their due 30 days after the filing of the answer.
1:10:27
Josh Bernstein: Level three level three is a what we call governed by a scheduling order Level three is governed by a scheduling order and none of the limitations and Rule one or two apply.
1:10:48
Josh Bernstein: Some courts most courts, if you look at the local rules it's not local rules but it's a court specific rules, a court typically has a.
1:11:01
Josh Bernstein: kind of a preferred or a I guess it would be a preferred type of scheduling order for Level three and other words judges don't just like are not going to want people to just say.
1:11:12
Josh Bernstein: You know, we propose a trial day 10 years from now, or we propose the five years for discovery and these kinds of things typically.
1:11:24
Josh Bernstein: You know the plan the discovery control plan must include certain things that are in the rule here when a new 190 point four also that matters listed in rural 166.
1:11:33
Josh Bernstein: Talking about a trial date, for example, a discovery period any limitations on discovery, you see, there are non enemy or kind of key deadlines for adding parties supplementing the pleadings designating experts.
1:11:44
Josh Bernstein: These are all things which are typically included in a level three scheduling order.
1:11:59
Josh Bernstein: The parties typically agree on a scheduling order and they propose it to the Court.
1:12:06
Josh Bernstein: Typically, you look at the guidelines that are in a judge's procedures where the judge says, I like to see discovery.
1:12:11
Josh Bernstein: period ending 60 days before trial, I like to see experts designated 90 days before trial, I like to see deadlines for parties and pleadings.
1:12:17
Josh Bernstein: You know 30 or 45 days before trial typically judges will have these preferences in their.
1:12:28
Josh Bernstein: In their in their on their websites and you tend to try to not deviate too much from what a judge prefers unless you have a good valid reason which, if you both parties agree, and you have a valid reason to judge might accept it, but that's basically the way that works.
1:12:35
Josh Bernstein: We look at this already about discrete sub parts.
1:12:55
Josh Bernstein: Oh, this is extremely extremely extremely extremely critical.
1:13:00
Josh Bernstein: If you wait for the last second you won't be allowed to issue discovery.
1:13:10
Josh Bernstein: discovery must be issued.
1:13:15
Josh Bernstein: sufficiently in advance of a discovery cut off, so that it can be responded to within the discovery period.
1:13:19
Josh Bernstein: This is, I can't repeat this and I can't stress how important this is.
1:13:31
Josh Bernstein: And we looked in our prior examples about the discovery period here's the Level two and in our hypothetical a minute ago we saw that the discovery period would end on April 30.
1:13:36
Josh Bernstein: If you wait till April 25 to issue discovery because you're issuing just thinking that you're issuing discovery in within the discovery period.
1:13:48
Josh Bernstein: you're you're not you're mistaken, you are not issuing discovery within the discovery period because the discovery must be responded to within discovery period.
1:13:56
Josh Bernstein: Typically, you get 30 days to respond to discovery, so a practice tip that I think you all should put ingrained in your heads right now.
1:14:07
Josh Bernstein: Is that if you are really coming up against a discovery cut off and you want to issue some additional discovery or even your original discovery make sure you calendar it for at least 35 days before the end of the discovery cut off remember.
1:14:16
Josh Bernstein: Even know things are typically not served through snail mail, these days, if something is served through snail mail, then they going to get three additional days to respond, I may get a practice tip and I, which I never ever.
1:14:32
Josh Bernstein: deviate from to.
1:14:47
Josh Bernstein: To to to calculate the discovery cut off in every case, and to back it up over a month and that's really the discovery cut off for issuing discovery.
1:14:50
Josh Bernstein: Okay, the discovery cutoff is the deadline for responding to or supplementing discovery responses.
1:15:02
Josh Bernstein: But the deadline for issuing discovery is not the discovery cut off it's 30 days or so before the discovery cut off don't make this mistake, this is a rookie mistake, this is a terrible mistake.
1:15:08
Josh Bernstein: And I have received discovery more than once that was issued before the discovery cut off right before the discovery cut off.
1:15:23
Josh Bernstein: What do I do as the responding Party I say I respond I don't respond or I respond 30 days later by saying sorry buddy you're late these discovery was issued outside of the discovery period and therefore we don't have to respond or I just make an objection to each other in that way.
1:15:34
Josh Bernstein: And it's going to happen, hopefully you'll be on the receiving end of some weight discovery and not on the issuing end of late discovery.
1:15:55
Josh Bernstein: Oh, this this was over here when we looked at the discovery control for number two Level two.
1:16:05
Josh Bernstein: and
1:16:16
Josh Bernstein: It talks about side each side has no more than 50 hours so what's a side if you've got a plaintiff and defendant it's easy to have sides easy to see who's on each side if you have one plaintiffs and defendants are each defendant.
1:16:18
Josh Bernstein: on the same side or a different side as each defaming allowed their own 50 hours or the last 50 hours total sometimes defendants cooperate sometimes defendant make.
1:16:33
Josh Bernstein: defendants may cross claims against each other, and so, really, that is the question for side is.
1:16:44
Josh Bernstein: Our parties who are on the same side like co defendants are called plaintiffs are they antagonistic to one another, or are they working together.
1:16:52
Josh Bernstein: If they're collaborating and working together they're going to be considered the same side if they're antagonistic and blaming each other and pointing the fingers then they're going to be considered their own sides, they could be more than one side in a in a case.
1:17:02
Josh Bernstein: One second I need to get some more water.
1:17:20
Josh Bernstein: Okay let's finish this up we're going a few more slides here.
1:17:25
Josh Bernstein: we're always.
1:17:29
Josh Bernstein: Okay, so.
1:17:32
Josh Bernstein: we'll 11 agreement remember rule of an agreement has to be signed by the parties and filed with the Court.
1:17:35
Josh Bernstein: And if you have deadlines that are.
1:17:43
Josh Bernstein: For example, in a scheduling order, as opposed to deadlines that are like imposed by the quarter by the rules, you can typically adjust them with a rule 11 it's not uncommon at all.
1:17:47
Josh Bernstein: To let's say you have an expert designation deadline or some other random deadline in the middle of litigation it's not going to affect anything the courts, not going to care the courts, not even know about it.
1:18:01
Josh Bernstein: Those those are typically modified through rule 11th if it's something that like you have to file with the Court, for example in towards the end of litigation if the.
1:18:12
Josh Bernstein: Court has issued an order requiring the parties to file with the Court a witness list or an exhibit list for purposes of trial.
1:18:25
Josh Bernstein: The parties are not going to be able to adjust that deadline, with a rule 11 agreement, the parties are going to have to ask the Court to adjust that deadline.
1:18:34
Josh Bernstein: If there's something that's in the middle of litigation like an expert designation deadline which doesn't require anything to be filed with the Court then that's the kind of thing that if the parties want to move it up or back a little bit.
1:18:43
Josh Bernstein: That they can do that type of thing with a little effort agreement.
1:18:55
Josh Bernstein: um don't forget about a certificate of conference certificates of conference are absolutely critical.
1:19:02
Josh Bernstein: I can't tell you how many times i've seen discovery motions and other motions filed against me without a certificate of Conference, I can tell you, without fail, that when motions are filed without a certificate of conference.
1:19:09
Josh Bernstein: That judges reject the motions and judges typically also admonish the party filing the.
1:19:24
Josh Bernstein: motion without without a proper certificate of conference remember in the local rules Dallas county it talks about specific kinds of.
1:19:33
Josh Bernstein: What must be contained in the certificate of conference that you have to try on the opposing side to confer with the opposing side on multiple occasions on different days, and you have to put it all in the certificate of conference.
1:19:42
Josh Bernstein: No judge is going to be if you're listening to me no judge is going to hear emotion unless there's a proper certificate of conference in the motion number one and number two if you fail to include a certificate of conference and emotion, you will likely get admonished by the Court.
1:19:56
Josh Bernstein: it's a it's something you really want to avoid at all costs, just it's pet peeve it's a pet peeve of a lot of judges.
1:20:13
Josh Bernstein: The easiest way to do is just to use the magic language which I do often I did one this morning and in case I was working on.
1:20:24
Josh Bernstein: you send an email that says, for purposes of a certificate of conference, what is your position on X, they will either say I agree or they don't agree we have posed a we're not opposed.
1:20:33
Josh Bernstein: it's not a it's not as it's like a short answer Question on an exam it's a short answer email.
1:20:45
Josh Bernstein: When someone says to you or to me if what for purposes of a certificate of confidence what's your position, I say i'm opposed i'm not opposed it's a one word answer doesn't require a a a.
1:20:52
Josh Bernstein: You know, a whole story, but please, please, please, please, please don't forget to include this in every single motion you file.
1:21:06
Josh Bernstein: In some jurisdictions, in some instances, a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment does not require a conference and mean they're.
1:21:14
Josh Bernstein: Not likely that the other side is going to agree to allow you to have the case dismissed, but other than a summary judgment or dismissal every other type of thing requires a certificate of conference.
1:21:23
Josh Bernstein: continuance is this is the last slide for this this.
1:21:36
Josh Bernstein: Presentation a continuance is when you're asking the Court to postpone the trial.
1:21:42
Josh Bernstein: Sometimes, continuing to as a cursor respond, like you, the Court will notify you that the Court can't make it the judge has a conflict, maybe they've got another trial going over or whatever, and sometimes the parties are not ready.
1:21:47
Josh Bernstein: Even though they have had a scheduling order with litigation, but there's lots of moving parts witnesses were not available for depositions experts, whatever things are taking longer and you might ask the Court to.
1:22:00
Josh Bernstein: To move the case typically judges are open every judges different typically judges are open to granted continuance is maybe once.
1:22:12
Josh Bernstein: Some judges, maybe more than once, but I would, I would say that, in general, it's it's a high likelihood of getting a request for a continuance granted if it's the first one, and in fact most emotions for continuance is say.
1:22:22
Josh Bernstein: This is our first request for continuance and you know and we haven't sought this to move this before.
1:22:39
Josh Bernstein: You know if it's the second, third, fourth continuance and the likelihood of the judge granting is starting to go down down down and the likelihood of the judge starting to get aggravated with the parties for not doing their work during the.
1:22:49
Josh Bernstein: litigation is going to go up up up so do your work and try to avoid continuing says, if the other party in your case needs a continuance, then let them file the continuance.
1:23:02
Josh Bernstein: Like a first, the first time around, it might be an agreed continuance both parties have a working together.
1:23:14
Josh Bernstein: there's due to unforeseen circumstances, we need a little bit more time we're finding an agreed continuance.
1:23:20
Josh Bernstein: And, and we haven't found one before and and judges likely going to grant that but you know, third, fourth, fifth time you know I don't know I would not want to be on the signature signature line saying I.
1:23:26
Josh Bernstein: am seeking this I I might say that i'm not opposed if the Court grants it, but you know.
1:23:38
Josh Bernstein: That that's that's the difference, but keep in mind keep in mind that if the Court grants a continuance that does not does not reopen the discovery period, even if the discovery period is closes 30 days before trial it doesn't automatically reopen the discovery period.
1:23:46
Josh Bernstein: If you're under a scheduling order under Level three you should the continuance should you should ask when you're asking for the continuance to also ask that all deadlines be adjusted the same thing with the Level one and Level two.
1:24:07
Josh Bernstein: If there's an order from the Court specifying deadlines, you should ask in the continuance that deadlines be likely moved, along with the trial date.
1:24:22
Josh Bernstein: But if it doesn't say that it's not automatically moved and in smaller cases if there's more time available, due to a continuance than a rule 11.
1:24:31
Josh Bernstein: Would would would suffice, in certain instances, for certain deadlines, but the number one thing i'm trying to convey to you.
1:24:41
Josh Bernstein: Is do not assume that if you're granted a continuance it automatically reopens discovery or extends the discovery period because it does not, you need to address this separately.
1:24:48
Josh Bernstein: If you filing a motion for continuance also asked that all other deadlines that are based on the trial they'd be adjusted accordingly.
1:25:00
Josh Bernstein: If it's the first continuance it's likely that a judge will adjust those deadlines if it's not the first continuance I would not be surprised if a judge.
1:25:08
Josh Bernstein: Granted continuance but does not alter deadlines, so you got to be specific and be aware of what you're doing this concludes our lecture for the which should be the first part of the discovery for the next week, and if you have any questions, please bring them to the next live class.
