 Okay, good evening, this is the pre recorded lesson for Thursday July 7 hopefully y'all have had a chance to watch the pre recorded class for Tuesday July 5 where we introduce some ideas about discovery and discovery control plans and and those types things.
 Now this class is going to be more about responding to discovery how we respond to discovery and how we serve objections how we serve privileges and these types of things before I get into the responding to discovery toward the end of the last recording We talked a little bit about.
 discovery control plans and scheduling orders, I wanted to show y'all something, let me share the screen here.
 Where is.
 One Second, let me see if I can well no that's not.
 Where his loop stop share oh that's why okay one second.
 One second okay now let's try this here know.
 to share screen let's share screen.
 There we go so let's see the share so this should be what you should be seeing here is the the Dallas county website, we we have looked at this before we looked at this one, we were looking up some information about local rules needs judges rules so.
 let's just click on the link for civil District Court hopefully y'all can still see this I clicked on a link for civil district courts.
 And let's just seeing the first challenge and see first judge is in the 14th district court.
 And judge more yea it looks like judge more he has some standard orders let's see what judge Maria has regarding the standard orange oh look it looks like judgment, he has a uniform scheduling order for Level one level two and Level three.
 And we'll just let's see let's just open this up and see what this is remember Level one is for the smaller cases so.
 It says that it's unless otherwise order, this is going to be controlled by Level one and it talks about different things about that designated experts, it talks about.
 motion to compel discovery.
 and
 It talks about men, the pleadings a certain days before trial talks about additional parties to this is this is.
 This is.
 Basically, what a scheduling order looks like it has deadlines in it and and, as you can see, the deadline set forth in this court order may not be amended, except by leave of court.
 Judge way has sketching order for uniform to and uniform three let's take a look at Level three.
 it's it's a little different level three is going to be a longer discovery period Level three is going to be more involved, we can see that it does have deadlines pre trial matters will be completed by.
 You know I made the pleadings fact discovery closes expert deadlines and so on and so forth.
 Of course, it also says that you know it's got lots of deadlines in here it's got limits for the amounts of deposition it's got additional parties, all these kinds of things, so this is, this is a typical.
 Typical scheduling order.
 And note and number, I think we talked about this at the end of last my last.
 Class with with you guys, where I said that a continuance does not automatically move deadlines note what he has here in his order.
 It says note that deadlines contained here in which refers to the initial trial setting.
 shall not change when the trial setting is moved unless specifically noted, so this is, in other words what this judge is saying in this order is exactly what I was saying, the other night, which is that a continuance does not necessarily.
 does not necessarily move other deadlines, if you need deadlines to be moved.
 Then you need to specifically ask the judge to do that sometimes parties seek a continuance because they have a conflict with the trial date that did not exist at the time the trial date was set.
 Other times parties need to continue into the trial date because they haven't yet completed discovery of need to do certain things, and in that instance where, if you still need to do certain things like depositions.
 You should not absolutely should not assume that those deadlines will be moved just by seeking continuance In fact it says it in here and just really wanted to highlight that to you.
 let's see.
 Let me.
 Go back to the, hopefully, you can still see this was in judge more yea he was in before he's in the 14 let's just take a look at another random.
 judge, I just want to show you here let's just click on the hundred and 6800 and 68th is judge redmond standard orders and it looks like a judge Reverend has has their own.
 scheduling orders for Level one and Level two let's see if there are any different.
 Okay they're similar for Level one and Level two and it looks like some of this language is similar to what it was in the other order, but every judge it might look similar but but it's going to be it's going to be different.
 let's look at, I just want to look at one more let's just look at like the hundred 93rd just randomly and we look at 193rd I miss judge does not have any standard orders.
 So the point of me, bringing this up, is that you need to take a look at each judges website and see if that judge you need to read that judges policies and procedures, why is this or something or my screen here that already I hope y'all can hear me.
 There is.
 I don't know if there's a way to check if y'all can hear me hopefully y'all can hear me um so what I was saying was every single time you have a.
 You get assigned you know it's all random you file a petition and you don't know which court it's going to wind up in once you get the assignment.
 Which is pretty immediately, but random you need to look up that judges website see what that charges standard policies and procedures are we already talked about this, if you here in Dallas county to look up the local rules.
 But in addition to each judges policies and procedures if you're looking into whether or not you need to scheduling order or.
 Or are going to be governed by certain deadlines with with regard to level one, two or three some judges have standard scheduling orders and some judges don't.
 So you need to look at each judges website for where your court where your case wound up and you need to make sure I abide by and comply with an use the standard scheduling orders that are in the judges website.
 We looked at a few we saw at some judge had some some judges didn't and the ones that did have sample sample scheduling orders they look very similar.
 You should read every word of each one that's in your court, I told you, the story where.
 I had a couple of cases in certain judge and in one scheduling order he gave me 15 days to do a certain response and in another.
 case for some reason it was 20 days, so I didn't read that close enough and that that mixed up and I actually missed the deadline to respond in the case where where the deadline was 15 days.
 Thankfully the judge you know gave me an extra few days to take care of that, but the point is still the same, which is that you need to read the scheduling order that that gets entered for each case you have, and they may be similar they may be different.
 let's.
 let's take a look now at our our PowerPoint for this evening, which is about responding to discovery, let me share the screen here, give me one moment.
 Okay.
 So.
 The the discovery rules are contained in the 191 9191 2345678.
 And that's those are the rules we're going to be looking at for the rest of the Semester.
 The basic this might seem basic, I guess, but when you you issue discovery in writing, you ask a series of questions they're separately numbered.
 Whether they're interactive stories seeking information or whether they are requests for production seeking the production of documents, and when you are responding to discovery you basically.
 You basically have you put the, the question that you're responding to first and then you put your answer immediately following it.
 These days, discovery is usually emailed to your opposing counsel and i'm sure you all know that in adobe you can convert the adobe back to work before adobe had the function of converting.
 converting a PDF to word, it was very common for attorneys to like if if I sent someone discovery in in you know in adobe PDF I would receive an email shortly after that says that your discovery requests, can you please send them to me in word.
 so that I can then you know, so that the Attorney can utilize the cut and paste and create the responses, because you're going to be cutting and pasting from the requests to create your responses.
 If you if you do that, you probably familiar with what's called sanitizing a document, if you do, send a document someone in word.
 You got to make sure to sanitize it if you don't know what sanitized means that asked me during a live class and we'll pull up a document will take a look at it.
 adobe of course doesn't allow someone else to manipulate the document so anyway, the basic form of a response is that it's preceded by the request I think I have a.
 let's see here, here we go here's an example on slide to an example here's a derogatory identify the facts that support your contention.
 Oh, so this we talked about this, the other day that this is a contention and derogatory this is perfectly fine and.
 You know the more specific, the better, as you can see, this is pretty specific and then you have the interactive story, and if they sent that a derogatory to me, then, or I sent it to them, then you cut and paste it and you put it in your response and then you add your answer.
 There is the proper response to an interactive story is called the answer and the proper response to a request for production is called a response.
 So a request to production produce all documents, excuse me, produce all photos videos sketches etc that pertain to the incident or the equipment involved in the incident.
 And then, that was the question asked to me, and then I set forth the the the response immediately after it typically, and this is just a couple of excerpts typically.
 interactive stories and request your production than to be asked in separate documents or they could be combined sometimes but typically it's going to be, you know.
 plaintiffs first set of interactive stories to defend it or defendants first set of derogatory to plaintiffs and same thing with.
 You know plaintiffs first request to production to defending or defendants first question production to.
 plaintiffs and so there's usually going to be more than one it's usually going to be depending on the discovery level that could be 510 1520 3040 and.
 So you're going to convert it to word and you're going to you know retake the caption off and take the signature block off because that was.
 The loan to the person that sent it and then you're going to add your signature block in your caption at the beginning of the end and then you're going to have.
 All the interactive stories, you know along several pages, so that you can insert your your answers same thing with the request for production note that note this response here that.
 The response references something called bates pages.
 bates pages one moment.
 dogs barking here.
 Okay, I am back, let us continue and we were talking about bates and labeling so bates labeling.
 And adobe allows you to do this, and if you don't know what this is look it up on adobe and and you can ask me in class.
 bates labeling is a way to actually put a label a stamp on the bottom of.
 every page these days adobe allows you to do it with the touch of a button and it takes one, second, and you can add a bates label to everything that you're producing there's several reasons why you absolutely positively want to bates label everything you're producing.
 For one thing, some courts require, particularly for trial exhibits and anything filed with the Court they require a you may have seen this in the local rules like a header or footer which has the cause number.
 And a page number and who's who's actually filing the document, so this one, it looks like you can add a prefix like I ate a dll that's for the Department of Labor and.
 One of the main reasons why, in addition, maybe being required is that this is a way to prove and verify.
 What the fact that you actually produced something to a defendant or to a plaintiff to an opposing side.
 Many times the universe of documents that are in someone's file is bigger than the actual documents that are produced to the other side that's probably because you're withholding some documents, maybe they weren't asked for maybe they are privileged and or maybe they're not responsive.
 And so you need to know what documents you're producing to the other side, frequently.
 discovery is exchanged, you know earlier in a case and then you're not dealing with a trial for months, or maybe in some instances year or more after you produced.
 file to an opposing side, and I can guarantee you between the time you produce a file and the time that you may utilize it and trial you're going to be doing a million other things and you're not going to remember what you produced.
 And the really the best way to remember is to have a file that is based labeled so you can and when you're sending the discovery responses to the opposing side you say.
 here's my here's my interactive story answers and objections here's my.
 Responses to request your production and here's the documents and producing and the cover letter you can say bates pages one through you know 1000 and so there's there's multiple levels of proof.
 Later on a trial if the opposing side asserts that you know our claims that that you didn't produce something.
 If it has a base label on it, you know you you pretty sure that you produced it and plus you can look back at the cover letter and look back at the record, and that is the way that we.
 That we do that, then when things are utilized in the courtroom there every it's rigged judges it's kind of a pet peeve of judges.
 When the judge and the witness and the parties are not necessarily on the same page away when you're looking at a document or an exhibit the way to solve that problem very easily is to have everything bates labeled.
 And so, if I say to a witness in the courtroom turn to page dll one or two there is zero ambiguity about what page, that is.
 The judge turns to do well 102 the witness turns the dll one or two and the opposing counsel terms to do well, one on two and everybody knows so bates labeling is a really good way.
 To make it very easy for everyone to be on the same page, and it also makes it very easy for you to remember and recreate what you actually produce much later in in the in the litigation when when you may not recall what you did a year earlier.
 We used to have.
 an actual stamp that that we had either us or maybe one of our legal assistance stamp every page and I had the one of those counters that each with each stamp.
 It came down and turn the page and did that manually now, thanks to adobe PDF it's just touch of a button, if you all should explore adobe and PDF and bates labeling if you're not familiar with it, let me know and we can.
 Oh here, I think this is let's see this isn't I wonder, I hope you can see, this under tools and I think it's under the under edit.
 Now that's header or footer okay it's not under tools edit it's under tools scan and here's bates numbering so it's that easy you just click ED and then another box comes up or no we're not going to do that, right now.
 And and it's that easy, let me just close this this tool and so anyway, if you have any more questions about bates labeling feel free to ask me or we do this in every single case, all the time 100% of the time.
 I did have an instance hours about two months ago it before the summer.
 We have a new returning the office and they sent me a file to review what they were going to produce, and it was not bates labeled and I said, why is this not bates labeled and and.
 They were not really sure why they didn't bake label it and I explained to them what I just explained to you, and that was probably hopefully the very last time that that person will ever not.
 bates label a file that they are going to produce.
 let's continue on.
 So.
 How do we object.
 And when do we object typically the Rules provide for 30 days response time.
 And you know depending if it's mailed you get three extra days but we're just going to go to the 30 days give or take you have to object to any discovery request it also has to be in writing.
 and
 You have to basically specifically identify the objection that you're that you're making.
 here's an example below identify every job your spouse has had over the last 20 years.
 I don't know what kind of cases is let's just assume it's a case where you got into a motor vehicle wreck and you, you know you had some property damage and wound up going going through litigation and discovery, and so I would say that if if you've gotten a wreck.
 What your wife's job history, probably has nothing to do with with anything so here's an example, we object to this interactive story, on the basis that it seeks irrelevant information.
 deadline for lodging that objection would be within the same 30 days.
 And you have to specifically state which are objection is, it has to be in writing and I see that 190 3.2 a says that it could be the objection can be either in the response or in a separate document.
 That that never ever ever ever occurs basically you're going to you're going to have a list of interactive stories.
 or request for production and you're going to have your answer or your response, immediately following that along with any objections that you have that pertain to that.
 Request nobody ever uses a separate document to lodge objections I have a practice tip here at the bottom, which is actually pretty important.
 to note, sometimes you may need a little bit more time to respond to discovery let's say in 30 days it's the summer July 4 weekend you're going at a town or you're going to be in trial.
 And you just need a little bit more time or you've requested some documents and information from your client, but your client is out of town and your clients not getting back to you or just for whatever reason it's complicated instead of.
 Being able to respond to an object within 30 days you need an extra few weeks so you send a rule 11 first you send a request to the opposing side saying you know, would you be agreeable to.
 To give me an extra few weeks, no problem and then remember what I said, I think I said this in the very first class on day one.
 The world is round, and you know I would say that 99.9% of the time, even in the most contentious litigation when someone asks me for a continual excuse me for an extension of time to respond to discovery I almost always granted.
 Because even in the most contentious litigation, I may need an extension on something, and if I say no they're going to say no, if I say yes, they should probably say yes to.
 And so.
 But the practice tip is that when you are seeking an extension of time, you must include in your request, as well as in the rule 11 that you formalize the agreement and filed with the Court.
 That you're getting an extension of time to respond to any object to the discovery i've had a couple of instances where people.
 fail to state the rule 11 agreement in that manner and instead stated it as follows, you know the parties agree that that.
 That such and such party will have an extra two weeks to respond to the discovery or meeting the part about objecting to the discovery and in that instance there was one instance where.
 Because objections were not referenced in the room 11 the other party held kind of assumed or expected the other party to.
 to object within 30 days and they produce the responses later.
 That was a little bit of a miscommunication the way to avoid that because it's almost certainly that you are going to need your extension of time to apply.
 To both your answers and responses, as well as your objections, so a simple way, and this is kind of a critical.
 Point it's a small point but it's kind of critical is that when you are getting an extension of time to respond to discovery make sure you include the language.
 I need an extension of time to respond to and object to your discovery and you typically would propose you know I need an extra week I need an extra two weeks, I need an extra 30 days to respond to an object to, and that would be what would be the other side says no problem and.
 And then you you reduce it to writing in the middle 11 and we get him signed.
 see what else we got here.
 So the Rules provide that sometimes requests are overbroad and if a request is overbroad This is important because this happens, almost all the time with discovery if a request is overbroad.
 It does not mean that you.
 can object to the whole request and say this request is overbroad instead.
 You must respond to the part of the request that is not overbroad you object to the part of the request that is overbroad.
 And you respond to the part of the request that is not overbroad here's an example here's a request seeking payroll record for the last 1015 years.
 it's overbroad because the damages that are sought just hypothetically the damages that are sought are only going to be for a few months, maybe a year, whatever, and so the point of going back a few years would be to see if the person.
 Had a kind of a stable employment history 15 years is probably a little over braun.
 for purposes of this example let's just assume at 15 years or now we're in 2022 12 years is is overbroad so let's take a look at the response.
 plan if objects to this request in the basis that it's overbroad and it seeks information from timeframes that time frames, that are not relevant, that cannot be your complete answer.
 That cannot be your complete answer the entire request is not overbroad you can decide now, it might be debatable and it might be a fight over the amount of time that's not overbroad but in this example.
 We agreed to go back five years to 2017 so we responded to the portion of it again see there's a bates bates labels and and and everybody knows what's being produced.
 In this example the attorneys proposed or determined somehow.
 That five years should be sufficient, the requesting party wanted 10 or 12 years worth of records responding party says i'm going to give you five.
 Now let's just put aside for a second whether that is or is not sufficient it's not the point here the point here is that the responding party decided that some of this was overbroad and some was not.
 The part that is not overbroad you have to respond to the product that is overbroad you don't have to respond to.
 If you're the requesting party here, and you disagree, and you have a valid or good basis to sandy in another couple years, even before set 2017, then you can call up your opposing counsel, the one who responded and say why did you limit this to 17 we need at least going back to.
 And you can discuss it with each other, and then you know.
 They can maybe reach an agreement, if not if efforts break down and just like we talked about last week, the parties are going to decide how strong their position is, and whether or not they want to seek traditional intervention.
 To get another couple years worth of records, but that that's that's me don't don't ask me what's going to happen if that if you go to court, I have no idea, this is just an example hypothetical.
 The main point of this hypothetical is to show you that if a request is overbroad you still have a duty to respond to the portion that's not overbroad I note, see the comment in comment to.
 These rules, by the way in the discovery rules, rules 191 91 234 all the 190s as well as many of the other Texas rules of civil procedure have comments after the rule, you can see them in all corners, you could see them in any rule book.
 Particularly and and the comments are different than the annotations the case annotations are some examples of cases that made it up on appeal that have interesting.
 Issues that that Congress wants to bring to your attention i'm not talking about the case annotations i'm talking about the comments the comments.
 or comments by the legislature that created the rule similar to you know if you look at the Texas rules of disciplinary procedure they have model.
 Rules aba rules and they all have comments after them to kind of clarify and expand upon you all should read the comments to these discovery rules for sure.
 Note the last sentence income into I think it's on the next slide we're 190 3.2 comment to here's the comment and for right now we're just going to look at the last sentence, the last sentence of the comment says that a party who objects.
 Based on remote timeframe should produce documents from the recent timeframe so it's even discussed in the rule itself and.
 This is something that you need to know this is something that if you object, based on things being overbroad or to remote and you don't answer anything based on that objection, you will be in the wrong.
 You will be in the wrong, the rules express the require you to you to respond to the portion that's that's an objective to.
 let's take a look at the next thing here Okay, this is actually interesting too, and this happens very, very often, I see the previous one, was 193 point to be this is also 193 point to be continued in that right 190 3.2 1.20 yeah dude you just respond with partially objected.
 This is more for request for production now in a discovery request it's going to say how the the time and place for the production, I mean obviously the time and place is going to be 30 days later at the requesting attorney's office.
 These days, it's almost 100% where things are produced electronically in the olden days, if things are voluminous we had actually go to offices and delivered by bankers boxes and these kinds of things, but.
 Now things are on CDs are there on the cloud and they're you know uploaded and downloaded and transfer electronic right and all these kinds of things.
 But what this room is saying is that if you can't provide the actual documents that you are trying to produce within the 30 day timeframe.
 And it is okay to say you have to still have to respond and object to the discovery within the deadline within the 30 day deadline.
 But you can produce material at a later time it is reasonable, with a reasonable explanation and if you state or time in place let's take a look at an example.
 This is asking for photos and videos the responses see the baits pages for the photos photos are not that hard to produce.
 In this particular case, we had a couple of videos that were gigantic and I was unable to email them and they were too big, so I asked one of my assistants to put the video on a CD and send it in the mail.
 And so the point of this part of this rule is saying that that is permissible that is permissible.
 notice that this is my actual official response and I said that what i'm going to do, I said I can't give you the CD today with the response but i'm going to mail you a CD next week, the rule says that you must stay at a reasonable time and place for complying.
 Now, that is.
 Perfect this is perfect, this is this is different than a situation where you need an extension of time to object to and respond to the discovery that's not what happened here.
 We were able to object to and respond to the discovery timely within the 30 day timeframe, but actually producing a large file, we were not able to do within the 30 day timeframe.
 So we didn't need to get a rule 11 extension for that instead we merely state in the response here's everything we're able to get you today.
 But we're going to put something in the mail and you should have the rest next week, that is perfectly permissible perfectly permissible what's not permissible, which is what I see a lot.
 In responses that I issue discovery and I get the responses, is that we quote will produce will produce you ask a good request and you get a response it's not objected to say we have responsive documents and we will produce them.
 We will produce them is not compliant with 193 point to be 193 point to be requires that you state a reasonable time and place for complying.
 When I get out, we will produce it, I immediately contact the responding party and say, when will you produce it usually that's just an effort on their part of delay.
 And if you wind up in court there's it's almost a certainty that the part of it, saying, without any explanation will produce and without stating a reasonable time in places the judges is going to rule against that that party, so what we see here under.
 Is we have two different scenarios one is that you object to part of the request and you produce the part that's not objectionable and one is you.
 object to and respond to the part that you're able to get to timely and if you need a little bit more time to actually produce something you can state a reasonable time and say this is when we're going to get it to you.
 This is, these are very, very common and if you utilize these rules correctly you'll be you'll be okay.
 let's see the comment you there's a couple of things that that are that are important in this comment an objection does not excuse.
 An objection to discovery design excuse the report respond and party from complying the request to the extent that no objection is made it's exactly the same thing we just talked about you can't just object to the whole thing.
 You know, unless the whole thing is objectionable here's an example, the Court gives an example produce all relevant documents, excuse me that.
 Is the example that the Supreme Court considered in the loft in case where the Court said in that instance it's okay to just not reply at all um.
 But you're not going to get a request to produce all all relevant documents that no one's going to do that if they do that you can inject into its entirety, if they if the request is any more specific than that your best option.
 is to object to the part that's objectionable and produce the part that's not objectionable or answer the part it's not objectionable.
 um.
 This is.
 Something that is abused, a lot parties tend to object to things, even when it's not necessary.
 Note in 190 3.2 D, that you can supplement your discovery at any time.
 And, unlike with cleanings where I urge you to use amended pleadings with discovery we use supplemental pleadings I sent some supplemental discovery responses to an opposing party earlier today.
 You may not have all the information and documents when you're initially responding, you may discover new information that might render a previous answer, not accurate, no longer accurate or no longer complete so you can always supplement your discovery responses.
 When if you don't have a privileged document or an objection to a discovery request responding.
 Then you don't need to make an objection, you have to have a good faith basis for the objection at the time you're making if there's the word it's like a preventative it's called prophylactic there's no.
 The courts do not want you making prophylactic objections meaning in the concept this request is objectionable, even though I am not withholding any information or any.
 documentation you don't need a lodge and objection unless the objection is actually objectionable and you are withholding information or documents.
 If you later obtained documents that would be responsive, some of which may be objectionable and some of which may be responsive.
 than an appoint you can amend or supplement your answer, not a man supplement your answer add some objections and add some new documentation, you can only.
 You can always supplement your discovery do not throw every objection in the kitchen sink in your initial responses, just in case.
 As a prophylactic measure that's that's what the courts don't want you to do you need to have a good faith basis for your objection at the time you're making it and if things changed later on, you could always supplement your answers.
 Now, if you fail to respond to discovery or you fail to respond to discovery timely, and this does happen from time to time not not.
 By me up and by you, but I have had a couple instances where I have issued discovery and the other side just didn't respond timely again not responding and not objecting timely and the.
 As, as we know, and we've talked about this word, this is a word that you want to avoid if you fail to respond or objective discovery timely then your your right to object is going to be waived unless, of course, good causes shown.
 let's let's talk about this for a second before we talk about the obscured part I had a case a couple years ago where.
 The discovery was mailed and it was mailed with a bunch of other stuff and it was opened by a I guess a you know office person at the front.
 And they it kind of stuck to the back of another document and the discovery was just completely missed the fact that it was issued was miss this was this was a while ago before.
 redoing everything now by email, and in that instance we totally missed that we didn't even know that discovery had been issued.
 Until the other side contacted us about a month or so later and said failed to respond to my discovery resort discovery.
 So in that instance, of course, you know, for them, they didn't just go right to the Court, and so you waive that you waive you wave now, we talked about it, and both sides judged, you know whether they would have a credible argument in front of a.
 Judge both sides Wade whether or not they would have a credible argument in court, and the issue in party decided Okay, no big deal now from today, they discovered it, you know.
 You have another 30 days, and so it was no big deal a couple of times i've issued discovery and they've been part of the other side they're responding party.
 They have totally missed the deadline and they call me up and they like it's an oh shoot, I think this happened, and maybe six months ago, and our lawyer call me up.
 And miss the discovery deadline later know shoot and and you gave me some reason he was out when it came in and whatever.
 And again if it's not on the eve of trial and if it's not no one's going to be prejudiced by it and.
 Like we talked about last week I don't want to do more work to compel this discovery responses and sick asked a court to rudy's wave is objections, I mean.
 it's a lot of work and if I if i'm not certain that i'm going to win and if there's a chance to judge may agree with him and his good cause, and for the error and it's not intentional than just you know, give them the benefit of the doubt so, but the general rule is that if you don't.
 If you don't make an objection timely it's going to be waived and.
 The first part of the sentence is something that is also very, very abused and this I have actually filed numerous motions to compel on this first part of 193 point to he.
 Take a look at the example.
 And it doesn't matter what the request is, but this is just an example.
 completed objects of this discovery request to the extent that is overbroad burdensome vague and ambiguous irrelevant work product attorney client and.
 it's kind of like we talked about the eeoc claim the eeoc it's religious it's gender its age it's it's national knowledge it's not it can't be everything the chances that everyone in these privileges applies to this whatever request this isn't this hypothetical is very, very low.
 If you see.
 If you issue discovery and you see boilerplate sentence like this in response to every single request you're making, then that is a violation of.
 I have brought discovery responses, so the court's attention, where every single response contains a sentence similar to this, and this is a clear violation of.
 This if there is a valid objection, and here it is obscured by numerous unfounded objections and the Court pardon me.
 The Court will rule that these that any valid objection is waived, to the extent that it is obscured by by all these invalid object invalid objections.
 I think in your in your career, you more than once, you are going to issue discovery and the other side it's going to be difficult.
 And you're going to see a lot lengthy sentence with these string objections to every request and if that's so read up on 190 3.2 and.
 file emotion, to compel based on 190 3.2 or emotion for sanctions the sanctions being that they waived all of these objections.
 it's that that is a good use of your time makes you look good it makes them look bad and you as the responding party, please don't do this.
 Those of you who are who are who have supervisors, like my supervisor right now it's our office protocol our office policy.
 To comply with 190 3.2, in other words don't put blanket objections in every response that they don't want us doing that they want us to only and remember it kind of dovetails to the previous.
 backup their previous one, which is make sure that you have a good faith basis for an objection that your lodging at the time, your lodging it.
 So this is just really another way of saying the same thing, but I can tell you this is an important rule and I have utilized this before with much success in the courts.
 Okay, so we were just looking at objections objections irrelevant objection overbroad objection they these kinds of things another concept completely is claiming privilege.
 Listen up if you're sleeping because this is important, an objection and a privilege are two different things to different things there and the rules handle them differently.
 190 3.2 F specifically says that if you have a privilege that you want to assert.
 That you should not object that you instead have to comply with the privilege protocol.
 let's take a look at what some examples of some privileges are and then we'll take a look at what the protocol is the method on how you how you assert a privilege.
 The rules of evidence to raise a Texas rules of evidence list a half a dozen or a dozen different privileges.
 attorney client privilege spousal privileged clergy privilege political privilege trade secret privilege informers identity privileged position patient privilege this class is not about.
 You know the ins and outs of each of those privileges, this is not evidence, you probably learned a little bit more about these and evidence.
 But these are privileges, if you are withholding a piece of information or a document based on one of these privileges that according to 190 3.2 if you do not object, you do not say.
 object, this is governed by a trade secret privilege it's not what you do instead what you do is you follow the rules of 190 3.3 which we're going to look at in just a second Okay, if you have an object going back now for a second if you have objections to.
 You know that you can meet that the timing or it's overbroad and you can't you know you don't want to respond to the entire request, those are objections, if you know going forward if you have.
 You withholding something based on a trade secret or an informer than that is not an objection that is a privilege that you were serving.
 And the rules, specifically says don't object to that, but instead follow the procedure in real 190 3.3 let's take a look at the procedure in real 190 3.30 we'll come back to that in a second so we're 130 3.3 is a two years it's a two part procedure first.
 You state in the response.
 You state in the response.
 That you are withholding information or documents that responded to the request.
 That is how you.
 That is how you assert a privilege, in other words let's say the request we looked at the request before for some payroll records.
 let's say the request is for.
 let's say the request is for some some you know let's say the request is for Coca Cola recipe okay produce the recipe, and you think the recipe and we're going to just go back here real quick to you think the recipe is a trade secret which it probably is.
 you're not going to say objection this request calls for a trade secrets you instead you're going to follow 190 3.3 and you're going to say.
 That we are withholding information or material responsive to this request, based on the trip and then you're going to list the privileges certain based on the the.
 Based on the trade secret privilege, that is how that is the first step is to steps, this is the first step toward a serving a privilege it's called stating that you are withholding something it's called the withholding statement.
 Okay, and this is Rule 123 point three A, and you state that you're withholding something based on a certain privilege it's it's very, very simple note the comment, and this is what we talked about a minute ago.
 That you can't make these statements prophylactic or, in other words preventively or, just in case or jic or whatever your your your term is that you use these days you only.
 state that you're withholding something if you are withholding something and remember if you if you obtain information and documents later, you can always supplement your discovery.
 But the way that you assert a privileged step one have to step one is you, you put a withholding statement in your response.
 What happens after you put it withholding statement in your response, oh let's see here, I have an example produced all interview notes.
 taken of the defendants employees.
 Okay.
 we're going to talk about this and we talked about this land Oh, we talked about this Okay, this is why this example is.
 In here because interview notes is his work product but sign statements are absolutely discoverable, so this is kind of being easy example.
 This request asked for interview notes, as well as science statements so and we saw in the rules of discovery that sign statements there's no objections know privilege it's not work product science statements discoverable so for science statements.
 For science statements you you're producing them oh right under one any 3.21 92.3 he.
 notes are not statements and the statements are discoverable we talked about that, and so you say okay i'm producing all the statements see these bates pages.
 Okay, but for the interview notes are you going to object to the interview notes now you're going to do step one in will 190 3.3 which is called the withholding statement.
 You say information or material has been withheld pursuant to the Attorney work product privilege it's as simple and straightforward is that let's go back it says that you must state that information or material has been withheld.
 And you say the privilege or service that is the first step it's it's very, very simple as that.
 And that's all it takes, so what happens after that what happens after that is that the requesting party if they want, they can try to get more information about what tree you're holding.
 In the way they do, that is, they asked for a privilege log.
 A privilege log privilege log is a log kind of like an excel grid where you list the document you list the object the not the objection of privilege and you kind of identify a little bit more specifically, for example.
 You only put enough information in there, that would allow the Court or the other side, before the court to see if they agree with you.
 So you simply state here that information has been withheld pursuant to the Attorney work product colors you don't know what that information is right so it's an interview known so in the if if the requesting party says.
 I want more information and they make a specific request for a privilege log.
 after receiving a response, indicating that material has been withheld, the party scene discovery may serve a written request.
 That they're withholding party identify identify the material withheld, and then you have a couple weeks they're withholding party can can provide what's called a privilege log.
 thrives the information withheld without revealing the privileged information to enable the other party to assess the applicability of the privilege.
 So, in other words if i'm withholding a note, I will say on the privilege log that is a note taken of an employee, you know by an attorney excuse me and it's not signed so that type of information will allow.
 will allow the Attorney who is requesting the privilege log and requesting the discovery to.
 To to assess whether or not the privilege is applicable sometimes the information provided on a privilege log is sufficient to enable the parties to agree, sometimes the information provided honor privilege log is not sufficient and the requesting party wants more information.
 And the responding party is unwilling to get more information, and then we get back to both sides have to weigh how strong is my.
 position and what do I feel will happen if I go before a judge I I actually had a case a couple of months ago, which was so stupid.
 I clearly identified on the privilege log that there were notes that I was withholding as well as informants actually was notes of interviews with performance, there was two reasons why the.
 The the stuff was being withheld and the requesting party didn't allege that the privilege law.
 Efficient or fail to comply with Rule 123 point three be but instead felt like our assertion have that privilege was faulty.
 Our assertion of that privilege was not faulty and we could not agree, and he filed a motion to propel, which was a huge waste of time I had to file a whole response and we had to go before the Court, and in two seconds, the Court.
 agreed with me and not him, and so I think that.
 You know, again, every time you go before the court you you're educating the Court a little bit about your case and about you know which side has credibility which side understands the rules and the case better or not better, and I think that was a huge step in that particular case of.
 toward us helping educate the judge that we were had credibility and we were following the rules and we.
 knew what we were doing, and it was quite obvious, the other side, did not, and so I think that was a mistake on his part to insist on bringing that to the court's attention.
 But anyway, this is the second step in a.
 In how you assert a privilege, and this is through a privilege log So the first step in asserting a privilege is you, you.
 You put in the response a withholding statement we are withholding material based on this privilege and in the second step, you actually if you are only if you're requested.
 within a couple of weeks, you can then you then have to provide what's called a privilege log which is really just a grid like an excel grid.
 Where you list the document you're withholding and the privilege and just a little bit more information about the document which would allow the, the other side to to determine whether you're being legit with the assertion of the privilege.
 Of these, these privileged slots are not very extensive kind of like my comment about the short answer exam typically a privilege it's just a couple of words and phrases it's not paragraphs.
 Okay, it looks like what it is we're going to talk a little bit about work product.
 And okay right so, and you know it's assumed in the rules that that you're going to withhold work product and attorney client it doesn't mean that, in some instances, you might not.
 Put attorney client, for example, I had a case where I produced a bunch of emails but a couple of emails will I will see seat on them as the Attorney, so I would held a couple of emails.
 And I put on there and they did I put it withholding statement on that they want to know more badge on a privilege log I said, you know we're holding some emails that were to come from.
 You know the Attorney and so, then there was there's there's nothing more about it, but you typically don't have to put.
 You don't have to put attorney client or work product on the on the word withholding statement or the privilege log because it's assumed that you're not going to produce that stuff.
 The comment also even actually says that the comment says that they don't have the state that you're that you have stuff that the lawyer was involved in because it's assume that that there's there's always going to be stuff from the lawyer and you're not going to produce any of it.
 So what is work product.
 Before we get into what is work product i'm just going to go back a few slides because I skipped a slide.
 This slide is as part of this section and texts rules of evidence which lists all the privileges and this is something I think we.
 Think I talked about this last week we talked about consulting experts, experts testifying experts and producing files complete files and redacted files, but if you.
 produce, I know I talked with you about this, if you produce a piece of privileged information that you have withheld if you produce if you if you share that with someone on your team like your expert than you you're going to be deemed to have waived the privilege.
 If the person with the privilege of voluntary discloses the privilege to another person.
 That is something that sometimes happens by accident, the biggest way in which this happens is, if you send.
 One of your witnesses or one of your experts, a complete file, which includes privileged information if you do that, you are screwed and you will for sure, be deemed to have waive the privilege.
 The worst case scenario which actually happened to me once a long time ago was a.
 I provided a redacted file, with no privilege documents, to a certain witness, and at the witnesses deposition.
 You know it's usually at the beginning of the deposition what documents to do review for to prepare for this position and 99% of the time they said I.
 Looked at the documents my attorney provided me, which was the redacted file, you know privilege documents all good this this this witness says, you know I reviewed the redacted file provided to me by the Attorney and.
 And then the questioning attorney says anything else in there any witnesses oh yeah I went and got all the privilege material and look at that, too, because I forgot what some of that said.
 And I found out about that at that moment in the middle of the deposition as you might imagine at that moment in the middle of the deposition there that other returned, he said Oh well.
 If he went and did that, and he looked at privileged information to prepare for this DEMO then there's no more privileged privileged has been waived, and we resist the devil, we had a huge fight and.
 I don't think I gave up the privileged information, even though I probably should have because, under the Rules that was waived, and so that's just bad bad bad also.
 This also happens a lot.
 Part two here is if the person testifies So if you withhold let's say with all the statement from somebody because it's based on information to, or whatever, but if that person takes the stand.
 And testifies that in they gave a statement previously, and this is all the information they have then there voluntarily.
 The privilege is stops at that point there's no more privilege if they testify about a privileged communication, then obviously it's the right to do that.
 And then it kind of opens the door, and then the privileged is no longer exists is happens all the time with informants, for example.
 Where we typically withhold information statements, but then, when the informant testifies a trial it's a moot it's it's a moot point, the fact that the informant previously gave a statement because we reproduce the statement at that time and it's fine.
 So two number two in this role will happen if you have someone who's privileged testifying about the privileged information that that is routine.
 Number one, and this is where you inadvertently send someone privileged information when you when you shouldn't have and by doing so, you wave a privilege that you did not intend to wave so don't do that.
 let's see now we're talking about work product so work product there's basically two kinds of work product.
 One second while I get a little bit more water.
 Okay, so let's continue to talk about work product so.
 Work product is basically.
 materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, as the key phrase in anticipation of litigation.
 Now.
 either by an attorney or by someone's representatives, think about this.
 We used to have this happen, all the time in MED mal cases and also probably happens all the time in.
 Like henry's insurance Defense cases, so an incident happens right let's say there's a motor vehicle wreck.
 And then the insurance company hire someone to come out and do an investigation or MED mal case an incident happens in the hospital conducting investigation or if there's a.
 Any kind of accident anywhere and then someone comes and conducted, but even internally like if you work at a company and and into factory and someone gets injured in the machine and the company.
 comes that comes down to safety guys come down to do we're doing an investigation.
 So.
 Is that.
 Is the results of that investigation or privilege based on work product, in other words, was that.
 investigation conducted in anticipation of Revelation one second shift.
 So we had this all the time in the MED mal cases nice to litigate and we have them now and a lot of the employment cases I already date.
 Which is the, of course, the the the defendant the employer, the hospital whomever is going to say that we felt we were going to be sued from the minute this happened.
 You know, sometimes that might be obvious, sometimes it may be false.
 A lot of companies have policies and procedures which require internal investigations to be conducted, if you are on the plaintiff side and you request.
 An investigation and accident investigation which exists and the opposing side doesn't produce it, because they say it was created, in anticipation of litigation and therefore it's being withheld, based on the work product privilege.
 You may find out that it was created, not so much in anticipation of litigation, but pursuant to the regular course of business pursuant to their own policies and procedures which require.
 investigations to be conducted in every type of incident, we had a lot of success we have had a lot of success convincing judges.
 When we have the right evidence, when we have policies and procedures in deposition testimony that these types of investigations are conducted routinely regardless of whether litigation and sue's.
 Long before lawyers are contacted and everything.
 And it's there for the regular course of business and therefore it's not in anticipation of litigation now when you know there's the pendulum swings back and forth.
 As more plaintiffs are able to convince more judges routinely that investigations are done not in anticipation of litigation, but instead, pursuant to the regular course of business.
 Then companies begin to hire an attorney sooner and bring an attorney out to the accident site to participate in an investigation.
 When those things happen, even if, even if litigation is not really anticipated it's going to be harder for a plane have to overcome.
 This this hurdle and it's going to be easier for a defendant to claim that certain things were created anticipation of litigation so.
 You know, think about in your setting if you are a lawyer and someone comes into your office to ask you some questions I had someone call me today to ask me some questions about.
 About a matter because that means that, from the day that they called me and inquired about the matter that little patient is anticipated, I mean I advise them to try to resolve the issues they had with the business.
 Without litigation because litigation is you know, costly and time consuming all these things, and you don't always win and blah blah blah so.
 it's a question right because you will uncover like at what point did you contact an attorney it will point to the Attorney send.
 A demand at what point was the investigation conducted like at what point did you really anticipate that litigation was going to ensue what point did you issue a you know, like preservation of evidence letter and these kinds of things so.
 What, in most cases it's going to be pretty clear when litigation is anticipated at once it is anticipated.
 The work product privilege kicks in, but there will be, in many cases, a period of time following an incident, but before a lawyer is involved, my battery's running low one, second, let me go get my.
 plug So if you are the requesting party, you are going to want to.
 expand the timeframe from the day the incident when it litigation is anticipated and if you are they responding party you're going to want to bring those two.
 Dates as close together as possible so that the most amount of information will be protected by work product one way to.
 explore, that is to explore, you know the regular course of business and the policies and procedures most large companies have policies which require investigations to be conducted.
 Following certain types of incidents, so it shouldn't be that difficult to prove that investigations are conducted pursuant to the regular course of business and not necessarily in anticipation of litigation.
 there's two types of work product is core work product and then there's other word product mo.
 you're talking about the memorable kind of category of what product which is called non core work product core work product non core product.
 I can't even think of an example of what non core work product might be, but if it's something other than and attorneys mental impressions and opinions, then.
 You can obtain it possibly put a showing of substantial need I can't really remember ever really litigating or insisting that.
 That, I had a substantial need for certain work product, arguing that it was not core work product and I can't remember ever me seeking that type of information and I can't remember anyone ever seeking that from me so 190 2.5 be to.
 The Non core work product is I don't think it's really that utilize that much in the real world.
 You know, regular law school class, you might spend weeks on work product and core work product and all these kinds of things, but you know, in general, the courts are going to tend to to to protect work product there's no reason not to.
 One area of litigation might be in the previous slide which was if it was not created in anticipation of litigation and it's not work product or not dealing with it still might be someone's.
 Conclusions or impressions, but if it's not created it in anticipation of litigation so at work product.
 also remember that facts are always discoverable so, in other words, if an attorney talks to somebody or attorneys REP talk to somebody and obtains a measurement or a factor date or what who, what, when where why.
 That information is discoverable that's not work product if an investigator goes to a site and determines.
 You know the mechanics of how something happened, and when it happened, and who was involved in these kinds of things that's not a mental impression or conclusion or legal theory.
 Okay, so it's foreseeable that you're going to have a page of notes from an investigator, with a lot of it, and this happens all the time, or with facts on it and the facts are produced, but then.
 It might be a section of the notes, it says, you know you know I think this you know might make us vulnerable or this has this might give us some exposure.
 We better look into this and correct this or you know that is clearly mentioned impression versus.
 You know this accident happened on you know X machine and such and such time and date and there was three witnesses, like those are facts so factual never facts are always discoverable and as long as.
 As long as it's it's an anticipation of litigation its work, product and if it's a mental impression or opinion that it's going to be considered core work product and it's going to be privileged.
 Remember, we looked at this, the other day on the, on the other, pre recorded segment at the the stuff that's in the disclosures and in the scope of discovering will 192 and and disclosures in 194 it's all it's expressly accepted for more product.
 Under the rules, even if it was created, in anticipation of litigation, such as experts witnesses statements contentions trial exhibits.
 pw K lists these kinds of things, these kinds of things you know they're the files are created in litigation, but they're automatically not.
 considered work product, and these are these are some things you need to know you need to know the mechanics.
 Of what is part of a required disclosure what is included in the scope of discovery and what is exempt accepted or exempted from work product and considered not work product, this is now the.
 third or fourth slide where we see that things such as witnesses and exhibits are not work product air part of disclosures persons with knowledge.
 You need to know these things do not object to the same thing we created our trial witnesses and our exhibit list and therefore it's work product does not work product.
 This happens once in a while and.
 And this happens, once in a while and there's a wolf for it particularly these days when large very large files when I say very large I mean files that have.
 10s of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands of pages of produce you know, in the olden days they were produced in bankers boxes, now that produced on flash drives and.
 You know, with with the deadlines that we have, and you have teams of people reviewing them it's possible that a mistake is made.
 And, and you realize whoops I produced something that was privileged I was litigating a case this year, where someone accidentally sent me something that they later claimed was privileged in my.
 I also few years ago realized that we produce something that.
 That was privileged now the rules.
 require that you that you have to timely in a timely promptly let the other side know what happened and ask for the material back now it's it's.
 You know it's hard to unring a bell it's hard to and it's impossible to unring a bell but the walls allowed for this, in other words.
 there's two instances that I can recall or in one instance.
 A party produce things to me and shortly thereafter the party emailed me and said, one of the and again that was all based labeled as a base page 392 was inadvertently included in the production and it contains privileged information and we want you to destroy it or send it back.
 So I didn't immediately go to 392 and read it, and you know, and you know and put it somewhere I I.
 happen to be a you know, an email that had the attorneys name on the top, so I clearly saw that it was a attorney client and it was produced by mistake and we just destroyed it and I responded by saying that we got rid of it and, and that was that.
 case a few years ago long time ago we produced.
 an email to an opposing side that had.
 That was actually an attorney client email and.
 And we requested the the material to be destroyed returned, and the other side refused the other side.
 felt like we didn't discover this promptly enough now the Rules provide for a 10 day timeframe from the date of discovery, it says a party who produces material without intending to okay.
 Does not waive it if, within 10 days after you actually discover that the production was made you identify the material and say to privilege state the privilege.
 So in that case, just like the Attorney did with me and they said oops we've produced this we want it back I said he produces want it back, and it was a long time after the production, but it was immediately after they realized what had occurred.
 In fact, we realize what we had what had occurred because they relied on and utilize a document that that was an email to to the Attorney and.
 Then we're like you can do that, we want that back, we didn't know that was containing the production, they did not give it back so we actually had a hearing on this 190 3.3 D call back, and of course we won.
 Because it was obviously privileged and we probably made the request back after we discovered that when it occurred, and they should have returned it there was no basis to not returning.
 You know the comment, for you know, is trying to give the benefit of the doubt to situation where you know do your best and sometimes you know you might have a team of.
 You know, new attorneys like you guys or legal assistance, so you know, and the fact that you may not have done an incredibly diligent job is not you can look at 190 3.3 themes that is that included in the wording of the role, no it's not included in the text of the rule.
 So it's not really an argument, I think that I now that i'm thinking about it and I case when we made the callback request and they refuse to give it back.
 I think they said that we remove we did not diligently we you know our error was was careless or whatever, and as you can see, this not part of the rule.
 What I have on the bottom of the screen here i'm just showing you that the Federal rules have the exact same snapback.
 Concepts symbol, the Federal rules and Texas rules that particularly these days were large voluminous things are producing people can look at every word on every page, even though you should.
 it's foreseeable it's very foreseeable and it does happen that things are accidentally produced, and it does not waive the privilege, if you ask for it back immediately upon realizing what has occurred.
 Just like we talked about with all of the challenges to.
 To you know that people have in an answer those challenges are waived if they're not made similarly objections are waves that are not made and those challenges are waived if they're not timely set for hearing and here we have the same thing when you.
 If you want something you need to timely set something for hearing so who sets it for hearing right look at the bottom last word on this page you don't set your own objection for hearing.
 it's the other side but requesting party sets the opposing sides objections for hearing other words.
 If I request discovery from you and you lodge an objection or a sort of privilege that I don't agree with and I seek to compile and I requested hearing if I lodge and rejection or sort of privilege I don't need to TEE up my own objection or privilege that's that's not how it occurs.
 And so, that is, basically, I mean it might seem weird but that's that's how this occurs it's the party seeking the discovery that must that must obtain a hearing on the, on the other, party's failure to respond like you would like you want them to.
 Sometimes the Court might want to do what's called an in camera review and it were an camera review is is sometimes maybe a privilege log of Judge can't tell from a privilege log.
 On you know whether the privilege to serve it is is is correctly asserted or not, so you can submit the document that you're withholding in camera and record can see you know.
 That it is whether or not it is, it is, it is privileged rule that way, if you submit something in camera, the other side doesn't doesn't get see.
 This is what we just talked about the party wanting to discovering and complaining about the objection has the burden bring in.
 To the court's attention and the party withholding this the discovery has the burden to support the objection of privilege i'm going to go back to the previous slide.
 The party, may I didn't say this a moment ago, but the party, making the objection must present evidence necessary to support the objection of privilege so.
 The party, who is seeking the discovery sets it for hearing the party, making the objection is the one who has to support the privilege sufficient for the quarter, you know, to make a determination.
 and
 What does this say here.
 Right oh it's the same thing we wanted the comment to 190 3.4 saying the same exact thing that that if you're seeking discovery that's what you want to bring the opposing sides.
 objections to the court's attention, and when you are seeking to avoid discovery, you have the burden approval so it's repeated in numerous places are numerous ways and again.
 Note that this is this first practice tip it happens all the time at trial all the time judges judges don't like this.
 You can't go to trial and then have a witness on the stand and say to the ones where we asked you for that you didn't give it to us, though trial is not the time to.
 To bring up discovery disputes, if you don't compel discovery or seek a ruling you can't complain about that a trial i've seen this happen, many times a trial where.
 The opposing sides trying to bring up some sort of objection that I might have made to a discovery request trial is not the time to try to litigate that that needs to be done promptly.
 After the discovery responses are made a trial of course you can say to like a witness when you ask for procedure, and there is no procedure that was produced, you can say it's true you have no procedures, but you can.
 You shouldn't be talking about the fact that they objected to discovery that you never saw it, to compel.
 we're not going to go into this a great length, but sometimes.
 When you really want to protect some things like we're trade secrets with Coca Cola there's a mechanism to obtain what's called a protective order.
 And again there's certain instances where you have to see protective order to protects the production of certain things.
 And it's just like we talked about if you don't see the protective order then you're going to then you're going to you can you have to produce what what what it is that you, you don't want to produce and and you know.
 You still you still have to you still have to respond an object.
 Okay, this is also this happens, a lot, not by me, but by the opposing side you can't withhold something and then try to use it a trial you can't do that that's that's underhanded and that's that's that's not allowed and.
 If you would hold something you can't use it to trial, and if the other side withhold something they can use it a trial.
 and
 I think I mentioned this in one of the prior.
 Discussions when we were talking about witness statements versus notes, if you have notes of an interview.
 And the interview is good and you obtained some good information but it's not signed by the witness so it's no it's, then you.
 could say that it's notes and therefore it's work product and therefore it's it's not a witness statement that's that that is required to produce but.
 The question to ask the attorneys is do you want to use the statement, do you want to do these notes, do you want to use the information and then, if you want to use it and produce it.
 Just shows us that sign doesn't mean that you can't produce it means it's not a written statement it doesn't mean you can't produce it and you don't have to produce it, this is, this is where this plays out if you don't produce it, you can use it.
 If you do produce it, you can use it so it's very clear always ask yourself with regard to something that you have the right to claim it's privileged you know Do I really need to claim this as privileged do I want to claim this as privileged or do I want to use this in the courtroom.
 For want to use it, I shouldn't withhold.
 amending and supplementing.
 Again, the rules talking about a many and supplementing but with discovery, we all supplement we don't amend orange we supplement our answers we have a duty to to supplement or discovery response when it was incomplete or incorrect when made or is no or is no longer a complete and correct.
 that's when you that's when you have to to supplement your discovery, particularly if it's dealing with pw K list trial witnesses experts that kind of thing.
 know that if facts change at a deposition which we're going to talk about a deposition a deposition is under oath are all parties are present the wouldn't be attorneys for all parties or Presidents taken down by a court.
 reporter it forms a booklet and everybody has it if something comes out in a deposition, then you don't have to go back and supplement your written discovery that you made your derogatory and request your production or to supplement that to add information that comes out of the deposition.
 And so the rules, the rules talk about this as well or comment five to 190 3.5 which talks about how if you if new information comes out and it's at a deposition what everybody's present and you don't have to supplement facts.
 But if you have responses that are incorrect or incomplete when made or no longer correct they.
 have to supplement those responses, so I think the next i'm going to guess is about when when do you have to supplement.
 You have to supplement reasonably promptly, I sent a supplemental discovery response out today Why did I.
 send one out today, because one of my witnesses contacted me yesterday and now provide them with some additional information I had previously sent an original response to discovery few weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago and.
 It was completed correct when I made it, but after the witness gave me some information, yesterday I realized there was one answer that was not.
 No longer correct, so I sent some supplemental responses today.
 supplemental responses only.
 changed one.
 answer and that's fine and I made them, you know, the day after I got the information, maybe it was two days later, so that's reasonably promptly, you know reasonably probably is pretty vague.
 You know if it comes out in discovery that learned about a fact, and you didn't to supplement until you know, a year later.
 that's probably going to be considered to be not reasonably promptly, a lot of times you see here that they might absolutely positively must supplement.
 30 days, no later than 30 days before trial, if you supplement and this is very important, less than 30 days before trial it's going to be presumed that it's not reasonably prompt.
 it's pretty rare for people to supplement in less than 30 days before trial, although that does happen and it's quite obvious it's going to cause prejudice if it's a substantive change and an answer.
 But what happens if they supplement 31 days before trial, so you know that's when the reasonably probably phrase comes into play, because.
 If you discover a fact at a deposition or through some new means let's say 45 or 60 days before trial.
 And you then supplement your answer 35 days before trial, while, on one hand, it is on the eve of trial, on the other hand, it's reasonably promptly after you discovered that fact.
 If you discover a fact that the deposition or through some documents that you obtained a year before trial, and then you wait till 35 days before trial.
 While not it's not going to fall into this category of less than 30 days before trial and be presumed to be.
 untimely you can still make the argument that it's needed and supplement reasonably promptly after you discovered.
 The necessity for the supplement so everything is a case by case basis, but as the responding party and you guys will be the responding party.
 You really try need to try to supplement responses that you know, are no longer correct reasonably promptly after you discover they're not correct that might be days, weeks, maybe in some instances, a few weeks, months, whatever.
 You know when when you're failing to do that, and certainly by all means never supplements something within a few weeks of trial some 30 days and will be automatically presumed to be untimely under Rule 190 3.5.
 you're going to probably have to show some good cause and it's going to be very difficult.
 And then right, this is, this is the the the the consequence if you don't timely supplement then you're not going to be able to utilize that at trial, I had a case earlier this year.
 Particularly with regard to witness.
 Was ridiculous if you look here.
 and included in the rules here is is personal acknowledge relevant facts and trial witnesses, I had a case where the litigation was going on for about two years.
 And it was literally the week of trial that the other side, decided to supplement some information about a witness, and I was like you gotta be kidding me and they tried to say some bs and.
 Of course, the Court did not find that to be good cause, and the Court found them to be to untimely supplement and the Court.
 ruled that that witness could not come to trial because you know they felt to make that supplement time.
 It was determined that they had obtained information long ago and it's actually contrary to other representations they had made in their discovery responses and that's unfair and it causes surprise and prejudice and there's no good cause and you're not going to do that in your career.
 And if someone else does that to you which may occur because you've got a lot of people with low integrity these days.
 Remember 190 3.6 and remember and when it 3.5 that they have a duty to reasonably promptly supplement their discovery and if it's close to trial they're going to need to have really, really good reason for it.
 If you find yourself in the.
 what's the word in the unfortunate situation where you discover, I had a case actually.
 Last year, where one of my witnesses got hurt and it was like the week or two before trial and an unrelated to our trial, but couldn't make it the trial as a key witness and needed this witness, so I talked to the other side and and they were you know not happy by.
 Knowledge and it was out of our control, and so we brought it to the court's attention and I sold a continuance knowing that the Court may not granted.
 But because we, we, the other side, had to agree not to the continuance or the supplement, but had to agree that that witness was a key witness and.
 If the witnesses, the key witnesses not available because of something that's unforeseen Okay, the judge actually move the trial like 30 days you know, to let the witness recover and be able to attend so but nothing's a guarantee, but that that that does that does happen.
 last couple of slides here just to remind you about.
 The difference between an objection and a privilege and it is very critical that if you have an objection and you launch it properly and it's very critical that if you have a privilege, you want to assert.
 That you assert it properly, not by objecting but by using the two parts and the 190 3.3 first part withholding statements, second part privilege log let's take a look here on the last slide.
 And there's a couple of just hypotheticals let's say you have a file that you need to produce as big and you only have a chance to review half profile before the discoveries do what should you do.
 wish I could call on you guys, but I can't.
 Maybe we should you know what i'm going to leave this last slide.
 And we can begin the next live class with this slide how about that that's what we're going to do.
 And the answer to all of these is going to be under proceeding slide So if you don't know the answer off the top of your head look back at this lecture.
 let's say you think a discovery request goes back too far in time what should you do let's say you believe in discovery request asks for emails.
 Asking for emails and emails but that include you what should you do.
 let's say after you initially responded discovery saying you don't have a testifying expert and change your mind, and now I want to designate an expert what should you do.
 These are some things that are very, very, very common all of these and you should, I think you must know not only for purposes of my class, but for purposes of being an attorney.
 How to handle these things, these things happen all, for these are different iterations of these happen all the time.
 i'm pretty sure okay that's the last slide for this this.
 This this lecture and if you made it to the last slide.
 you're still awake we're going to begin the next live class with that slide as a little bit of review to how to respond to discovery.
 I hope you enjoyed this and any questions like I said the other day any questions you have about this lecture or the one that the other pre recorded lecture please come to class next into into tuesday's on July.
 One minute let's take a look at the calendar next week is July 5 and seventh that's what these are for July 12 please come to class on July 12 any questions from these two lectures, including some thoughts about the last slide of this lecture have a good night and a good weekend.
